<p>The two weeks’ voyage from Galle to Hong Kong is pleasantly
broken by visits to Penang and Singapore. On the
fourth day out, mountainous islands appear above the
smooth stretch of sea, and late in the afternoon we anchor
in the harbor of Penang at the head of the Straits of Malacca.
Penang is an island fifteen miles long by eight in
width, on which a mountain towers nearly 2,800 feet high.
The native town lies on the flat strip of land adjoining the sea,
but the bungalows of the European residents nestle on the
hill slopes. We go on shore in a Sampan boat, and find the
almond-eyed Celestials here in full force, not the gliding,
apologetic creatures we see in San Francisco, but a sturdy,
independent, self-assertive people, with the industries of the
town in their hands. There are some grandees among them,
for we see Chinese gentlemen lolling back in luxurious carriages,
with Hindu coachmen and footmen. The joss houses
are numerous, the roofs of which resemble immense ornate
canoes, with sea-monsters at either end, as their forms are
outlined against the evening sky. We have only time for
a drive through the principal streets. The lights are gleaming
out along the shore, and the twilight is fading as we
float over the waves to our sea-home, the “Gwalior.” The
next day we are in the Straits of Malacca, with picturesque
views of Malay villages and tropical vegetation. The temperature,
which has been in the nineties, dropped a few degrees
as we approached the outlet into the open sea, and,
going on deck on the second morning after leaving Penang,
the air was still further cooled and freshened by a tropical
downpour of rain just as we were passing the wooded islands
which lead to the beautiful harbor of Singapore. These
clouds, the rain, the temperature, and the deciduous trees
make us think of home, and especially as this land-locked
harbor might be a Scottish or American lake instead of the
outlet of the Straits of Malacca, seventy-nine miles above
the equator.</p>

<p>The P. &amp; O. steamers stop for coal at a wharf some three
miles from the town, but we had the satisfaction of walking
from the steamer to the land without the usual intervention
of a small, wave-tossed boat. We engaged a comfortable
looking carriage attached to an absurdly diminutive pony,
but the driver insisted that it was “good horse, good horse,”
and we found that there was a wonderful amount of speed
and endurance in the creature. Beautiful specimens of the
traveler’s palm outline their huge, fan-like semicircle of
leaves against the sky. This growth belongs to the plantain
rather than the palm family, and is called the traveler’s
palm because it contains a reservoir of water which runs
down the grooves of the long stems and is retained at the
base, where the incision is made, and the precious fluid,
cool and refreshing, flows out. We saw again the <i>acacia
flamboyante</i>, that splendid tree with its crown of scarlet
blossoms, whose acquaintance we first made in the gardens
of the Taj, and which came originally from Rangoon and
Sumatra. Here, as in Penang, the Chinese are the chief
factors in all the industrial pursuits. The temperature
ranges from 80° to 90° the year round, and we were assured
by European residents that the eye wearies of constant
greenness and longs for the changing seasons of the temperate
zone. The evening on our quiet steamer, which is anchored
here for the night, reminds us of Lake George. The
wooded heights and islands dream under the light of a full
moon, while the constellation of the Southern Cross hangs
over against Ursa Major. Early the next morning the
Malay boys appear on the scene. They are equal to the
Somalis for diving, but the charm of novelty is gone, and
they do not seem such merry, audacious creatures as those
who entertained us at Aden. Boat loads of coral and beautiful
shells followed us for some distance, but we soon lost
sight of them as we steamed away past the green and sunlit
islands into the open sea.</p>

<p>After six days of debilitating moist heat in the China Sea,
we were met on our approach to Hong Kong by a sudden
change of temperature—a strong, fresh breeze following a
heavy shower accompanied by thunder and lightning. Our
ship scarcely moved during the night previous to our reaching
the coast of China, for it was very dark, and we were
entering upon a network of rocky islands. When we went
on deck in the morning what a change in all our surroundings!
Purple and blue mountains, reminding one in their
general form of Scottish heights, yet with that peculiar shade
of green which belongs to the hills of Wales, rose out of the
sea on every hand—giant peaks of vast, submarine ranges.
For twenty-five miles or more before reaching the superb,
land-locked harbor of Hong Kong, we threaded our way
among these mountainous islands, beautiful in form and
color, and lighted up now and then with a sudden sunburst.</p>

<p>Hong Kong is built on an island and belongs to the British.
The town extends for some distance along the shore
and creeps up the slope of Victoria Peak, which rises to a
height of 1,800 feet. The European houses, nestling among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
the trees, present a very attractive appearance with their
double-storied, arched verandas. The magnificent bay resembles
one of our inland lakes with mountains rising on
all sides, from a few hundred to nearly 2,000 feet high.
Here are ships of war, ocean steamers from all ports, trading
junks of every shape and color, floating, thatched-roofed
homes, where in one boat three generations are often
found, and in which birth and death and all the round of
human life occurs. Stalwart, sturdy women, with babies
strapped on their backs, use as much strength and skill in
the management of the boats as the men, and it would be
hard to distinguish the sex if it were not for the added burden
imposed on the woman. The streets are so steep in
Hong Kong that horses are very little used and the vehicles
employed are sedan chairs, attached to long bamboo poles,
and carried on the shoulders of two, three or four coolies.
This open, airy vehicle is an immense improvement over
the heavy, funereal palanquin of Calcutta. John Chinaman,
with his inevitable pig-tail and fan, his blue, loose
garments and immaculate hose was everywhere present,
and the odors of sandal wood and dried fish were all pervasive.
We went to the curio shops which line the arcades
of Queen’s Road and saw lacquered wood and ivory carving
to our heart’s content. The Chinese shop-keeper holds himself
aloof from the purchaser with true Celestial indifference.
You enter his shop and examine his wares. No
one accompanies you in your round. If you want to know
the price of an article you must seek out the proprietor or
clerk and inquire. You feel that the price is “fixed,” and
even after three months’ demoralization in India you have
not the presumption to ask this lordly Chinaman to take
less. A pathetic proof of the chronic home-sickness which
seems to possess European residents in the East, and which
we ourselves appreciate, is the text engraven on the stone
arch of the post-office doorway: “As cold waters to a thirsty
soul, so is good news from a far country.”</p>

<p>The morning after our arrival in Hong Kong we leave the
“Gwalior” which has been a most comfortable, agreeable
home to us for the past two weeks, in order to visit Canton.
It is a sail of some eight hours up the Pearl River to
Canton, and we found ourselves on an American-built
steamer not unlike our river boats at home, although not
so luxuriously furnished as our floating palaces on the
Hudson. However it gave us quite a home-like feeling,
which was still further enhanced by the captain being a fellow-countryman
and the breakfast bill of fare including
waffles, griddle cakes and ice water. Although we are at
the antipodes of Boston, we have a strange sense of being
nearer home than at any time since leaving England. Sitting
at the breakfast table the captain pointed eastward toward
the open sea and said, “In that direction you can
travel 6,000 miles before reaching land, and the nearest
shores are those of America.” Knowing the reputation
the Chinese have for being a peaceable race we were
somewhat surprised to see that the wheel house was
quite an armory of weapons, and that the companion-ways
were closed and guarded. Inquiring into the meaning of
these war-like demonstrations, we were told that not many
years ago the Chinese passengers on one of these river
steamers conspired together and, when the captain and the
few Europeans were at lunch, they rose, seized the weapons,
murdered the whites and took possession of the boat. Since
that time unknown passengers, of whom there were on this
trip about one thousand, are kept carefully guarded. The
scenery was very pretty as we steamed up Pearl River, the
banks being visible on either side. The chief characteristics
of the view were low rice lands, or paddy fields as they
are called here; distant blue mountains, the last spurs of
the Himalayas; terraced pagodas of five, seven, or nine stories
high, with trees and shrubs growing from the top and sides;
bamboos, plantains and deciduous trees, and at one point
in our journey was a knoll of pine trees with a carpet of
brown sheddings, which reminded us of the spot at Concord
where Hawthorne is buried. The most prominent building
in Canton and the one which first attracts the attention of
a stranger, is the stately, granite Catholic cathedral. It was
a hopeful sign to see this imposing Christian edifice with
its twin towers looming up above the low-roofed houses and
temples of this distinctively Chinese and heathen city.
Another noticeable feature among the buildings was eight
or ten huge, gray, square towers, which we were told were
pawn houses.</p>

<p>We had heard of the boat population of Canton, and here
we saw swarming crowds in their floating homes as we
neared the wharf. Families not only live in these boats, but
they carry on quite a trade in ferrying passengers from one
point to another. They are a race by themselves, and are
looked down upon with suspicion and unkindness by their
brethren of the terra firma. They are considered as aliens of
contemptible origin, and are prohibited from intermarrying
with landspeople. Before we left the steamer we were met by
a decently-dressed Chinese woman who had come on board
as a “drummer” for one of the hotels. But a gentlemanly
looking Chinese guide who could speak English had already
been recommended to us by the captain, and we put ourselves
in his hands, to be taken first to the missionary headquarters.
We left the densely crowded wharves in sedan
chairs, each of us with three bearers, and proceeded through
narrow streets, where nearly every one is on foot, apparently
with some definite object in view, for they move along, these
blue-costumed Celestials, silently and swiftly. Most of
those we see belong to the middle or lower classes. Many
of them are carrying heavy burdens suspended on a bamboo
stick which is slung across the shoulders. The bamboo is
as important a growth in China as the palm in India. Almost
every article of furniture in a Chinese habitation is
made from the bamboo—chairs, tables, screens, bedsteads,
bedding, paper, and various kitchen utensils. It is also employed
on boats for masts, poles, sails, cables, rigging and
caulking. It is used for aqueducts and bridges, and it can
be made into a swimming apparatus or life preserver, without
which no Chinese merchant will undertake a voyage.
The leaves are generally placed around the tea exported
from China to Europe. It is also used as an instrument of
torture in the bastinado, which is the punishment most frequently
inflicted in every part of China, and for almost
every species of offence, the number of blows being regulated
by the magnitude of the crime. The criminal is held
down by one or more coolies, while the chief actor, furnished
with a half-bamboo six feet in length and about two inches
broad, strikes him on the back part of the thighs. In this
degrading punishment the rich and the poor, the prince and
the peasant are included. The Emperor Kien Long ordered
two of his sons to be bambooed long after they had reached
the age of maturity. The Presbyterian Mission occupies
pleasant grounds which slope down to the Canton River.
There are three substantial brick houses, one of them being
occupied by the medical missionary, Dr. Ker, the other by
the preacher, Rev. B. F. Henry, and the third by the ladies
who have charge of the school, Misses Noyes and Butler.
We were received most cordially by Mrs. Henry, who
urged us, with such unmistakable earnestness, to stop with
them during our twenty-four hours in the city, that we
promised to return after making a tour of inspection with our
Chinese guide. The chief place of interest shown us was the
Temple of the Five Hundred Genii, a collection of sitting,
life-size statues rudely painted and gilded, hideous or grotesque
in expression, and sometimes with bright blue hair
and beard! In one of the outer corridors leading to this
temple was a group of Chinese youth playing shuttle-cock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
their feet taking the place of the battledore. At a Buddhist
temple near by we saw several priests going through their
genuflexions and prostrations, which reminded us of the
ceremonies at Rome. Our guide seemed chiefly anxious to
show us the best quarters of the city, and to induce us to
buy something at the shops, whereby he himself would
doubtless have had a certain commission at our expense.</p>

<p>The next morning we began our peregrinations by visiting
Dr. Ker’s hospital before breakfast. This institution is
for the benefit of the natives and is undenominational, being
supported by the foreign residents of Canton, who
number less than an hundred among the million of the Chinese.
In contrast with the large, airy wards and the convenient
appointments of the hospitals of Europe and
America this seemed pitifully mean and poor, but it was
neat, and much valuable work has been done here. Many
more patients apply than can be accommodated, as it is the
only institution of the kind in this great city. Directly
after breakfast we found Miss Noyes waiting to take us over
the boarding-school for girls and women. This building
was planned by Miss Noyes, and its recitation-rooms and
dormitories, with accommodations for one hundred boarders,
are admirably well arranged. It seemed strange, remembering
the Hindu school-girls, with their salaams and
musical “Nâmâska, Mem Sahib,” to be received in perfect
silence by these Chinese maidens, who all rose to their feet,
however, as we entered, and then came forward two by two,
paused in front of us, made a deep curtsey, and, instead of
shaking hands with us, each clasped her own hand and
raised it to her forehead. This operation, repeated in solemn
silence, became rather embarrassing to us and we
begged the teacher to present our general greeting to the
school and to excuse us from these special obeisances.</p>

<p>Coming from the school we found Mr. Henry waiting with
three sedan chairs and their bearers in attendance to show
us the sights of the city. The Merchants’ Guild consists of
a series of buildings fitted up with much elegance and taste
and combining a council hall, temple and theater. The
rooms have no luxurious upholstery, but the black-wood
furniture is highly polished and elaborately carved. The
screens are embroidered and painted in the highest style of
Chinese art, and there are numerous mirrors which, in the
East, is always a sign of wealth. Among the various
temples we visited the one which most impressed itself upon
us, and where we saw the greatest number of worshipers,
was called, very appropriately, the Temple of Horrors. It
was a Dante’s “Inferno” put into a hideously realistic form.
It is the Chinese conception of the future torments of the
wicked, and those who have been guilty of the crimes whose
punishment is here portrayed come to expiate their guilt
by bribes. The gods these poor heathen worship never inspire
in them love, but fear and a dread of impending
wrath. The court leading to this temple was filled with vociferous
hawkers, and the greatest confusion prevailed. A
dentist’s stand was festooned with the teeth of his victims!</p>

<p>From this revolting heathen temple we went to the daily
noon service in the Presbyterian chapel. The doors were
thrown open on one of the busiest streets of this packed
city, and soon a crowd came drifting in out of curiosity.
Mr. Henry read and explained passages of scripture for
nearly half an hour with great earnestness, and succeeded
in attracting the attention of those who at first were simply
gazing at us, the visitors, with a stupid stare. The crowd
was orderly and quiet. One man was smoking. An open-mouthed
boy on the front bench soon fell asleep. There
was no deep earnestness in the faces, but we were told that
at almost every gathering of this kind, two or three are sufficiently
interested to remain after the service and ask questions.
One of the chief difficulties in making any religious
impression upon the Chinaman comes from his sublime
self-complacency. Even the meanest of the people, our chair
bearers for instance, look down upon us as “white devils,”
and according to their doctrine of transmigration, they believe
that we are the re-appearance of those who in a former
state of existence were bad Chinamen. No wonder
that regarding us with such contempt it is hard for them to
accept our religion. The Examination Hall interested us
greatly, for here is the real entrance to the aristocracy of
China, which has its recruits not from the ranks of the high
born and wealthy, but from all classes who have attained
excellence and thoroughness in scholarship. Once in three
years thousands come here to compete for the second literary
degree. They are locked in a great enclosure containing
ten thousand cells resembling horse stalls in a country
church yard. These cells are six feet long by four feet wide,
perfectly bare with a ground floor. Every candidate is expected
to write an essay, an original poem, and a portion of
the Chinese classics. The strictest watch is kept over the
students so that they may not communicate with each
other. The same subjects are given to all at daylight and
the essays must be handed in the following morning. Out
of the 8,000 who competed at the last examination, only
130 passed, and these are booked for promotion in civil offices.
They are also required to go to Pekin to compete for
the third degree. The streets and the people are, after all,
the most entertaining sights in Canton. The dimly-lighted
narrow streets make a gay picture, the business signs of
long lacquered or gilt boards with the Chinese characters in
red or black being hung perpendicularly before the shops.
These open shops, with their tempting display of embroideries
and ivory carvings, gay lanterns and fans, we gaze
into as we pass along in our sedan chairs. Many of the
streets have high-sounding names, such as Longevity Lane,
Ascending Dragon Street, Great Peace, and Heavenly Peace
streets. The names on the signs are not infallible guides to
the true character of the proprietor; for instance a most unscrupulously
sharp dealer had modestly advertised his abode
as “The Home of the Guileless Heart.”</p>

<p>We were to take the afternoon boat to Hong Kong in
order to catch the next P. &amp; O. steamer for Yokohama. A
dozen or more of our friends came to see us off. It was a
pathetic and yet an inspiriting picture to look back upon
this little company of our countrymen and women as
they stood on the wharf waving their farewells, for they
seemed such a feeble folk as compared with the teeming
million of this crowded Chinese city, and yet they were
there in obedience to that divine command, which Wellington
has so aptly called the “marching orders of the church.”</p>

<p>What a rest it was after the excitement and rush of our
busy twenty-four hours in Canton to glide with quiet, easy
motion, down the Pearl River as the sun was setting. The
wooded islands glassed themselves in the still waters. Our
stately steamer had as little motion or noise as a phantom
ship. We passed native junks on which the bull’s-eye was
prominent on either side the bow. The Chinese consider
these indispensable to the safety of a ship; their argument
being: “No got eye, how can see,” and with these guardians
the easy-going mariners give themselves liberty to sleep on
watch while the craft is on the <i>qui vive</i> for danger!</p>

<p>Reaching again the harbor of Hong Kong we exchange
our roomy, river steamer for more contracted quarters on
board the “Sunda,” which is to bear us to Yokohama. Five
days tossing on the rough China Sea, which reminds us
more of the North Atlantic than anything we have experienced
since crossing that turbulent ocean, and we rejoice
to hear on the sixth morning out that we are nearing the
shores of Japan. Through the courtesy of the first officer
we are invited on the bridge, and from this favorable
place of outlook we watch our tortuous course through the
network of islands which are clothed in all the fresh beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
of spring. Rocky islets and hills, covered with pine forests,
and low-growing shrubs lift their green heads out of the
sparkling blue waters. Clusters of houses are scattered
along the hill slopes, and they harmonize with the landscape
in a way that would delight John Burroughs. There
may be much Japanese history and legend connected with
these heights, but we are ignorant of it all, and to us they
rear their heads unsung.</p>

<p>Nagasaki harbor is not unlike Hong Kong, but the town
itself does not make so much of an appearance. The Japanese
boats resemble somewhat the Venetian gondolas, painted
white instead of black. We went on shore in one of these
row-boats, and each of us took a <i>jinrikisha</i>, which resembles
a Bath chair, or a magnified baby carriage, and is drawn by
one or two men, according to the avoirdupois of the occupant.
One can best understand Japanese art here in its native surroundings,
as one can only thoroughly appreciate Dickens’s
characters in London. These Japanese ladies, with their
glossy black hair and head ornaments, their almond-shaped
eyes, full, pouting lips, and the peculiar contour of the
tightly-draped figure, how familiar they look! Yet where
have I seen them before? Only on pictured screens and
painted fans and embroidered hangings, but here they are,
these same quaint creatures in veritable presence. Through
many narrow streets, and around sharp corners, and over
bridges, and in sight of stony water-courses, and the sun-deluged
tender green of the mountain sides, our <i>jinrikisha</i> men
rattle us along on our way to the photographer’s, where we
find unexpected good fortune in the shape of beautifully colored
views. At the chief tortoise-shell emporium of the
town we are received as guests rather than purchasers. Our
European bow seems an impertinent nod compared with the
profound salaams which are bestowed upon us. We are invited
to take seats at a large centre-table in a cheerful apartment,
which is a combination of parlor and show-room.
Straw-colored tea in dainty cups of exquisite porcelain is
brought to us. Medals from various exhibitions are shown,
but there is no undue eagerness to sell their wares, and
when at last we make our selection and offer silver rupees
in payment we are blandly informed that they can not accept
foreign coin. Although we assure them that the rupee
has been weighed in Canton, and they can take it at its exact
metal value, yet they are politely inexorable, and we
meekly walk away feeling like impostors as well as boors.
At three o’clock in the afternoon we are moving out of the
harbor, and it is a cheerful omen as we watch the receding
shores to be told that the most prominent building on the
hill-slope, a large, new structure, is a school-house for Japanese
girls, under the auspices of Methodists from our own
country.</p>

<p>Soon after sunrise the next morning we enter the straits
of Shimonoseki, the narrow entrance to the Inland Sea.
We remember that this newly risen sun which is shedding
its golden glory on these thousand islands, has just tinged
with its farewell rays the elms of New Haven and the encircling
heights of Lake George. A member of our party
once said to some young Japanese visitors in Boston, “Do
you want to see the sun rise on Japan?” and in response to
their bewildered acquiescence he took them to a west window
and pointed to the sun sinking, with gorgeous pageantry
of color, behind the Milton hills. All day long we glide
through placid waters, the scene varying with every turn of
the wheel. Islands of most fantastic shape rise everywhere.
Sometimes an abundant vegetation clothes them from head
to foot; again they are not only destitute of clothing but of
flesh, and show only a bony framework of jagged rock
pierced by grottoes and caves. Along the shores, indented
with bays, is a fringe of fishermen’s huts. Range after
range of mountains rise back of each other in beautiful outlines
varying in color from green to softest blue and faintest
grey until the most distant heights melt into the horizon.
We pass curious fishing junks with square, puckered sails.
In the midst of these foreign looking boats we are surprised
to see now and then a trim little schooner, exactly like
those we are familiar with at home. We pass one American
man-of-war with the national flag flying. It seems a pity
that half of our passage through this marvelous Inland Sea
must be made in the night, although we have the anticipation
of seeing in the morning Fuji-yama, the Peerless Mountain,
worshiped by the Japanese as divine. A note from
our attentive first officer breaks up our morning nap with
the announcement that Fuji is visible and we hasten on
deck to see the snowy cone of this youngest mountain in the
world lift itself above the clouds into the blue sky. It has
the shape of an inverted fan, and from the sea you can trace
its outline from base to summit to a height of 14,000 feet.
According to Keith Johnston, it was thrown up by some
tremendous convulsion, for which this volcanic region is famous,
about 300 B. C.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon our ship dropped anchor off Yokohama,
which thirty years ago was an insignificant fishing
village. When Commodore Perry appeared with his fleet
in this bay, in 1853, the rude inhabitants were filled with
wonder at their first sight of a steamer, and when they saw
the spark-spangled smoke rising from the stacks at night
they were seized with superstitious awe of the foreigners,
who they thought had imprisoned volcanoes on their
ships! Tokio is the literary center of this part of Japan
while Yokohama is commercial, and has not only a modern,
but really an American appearance, and in the hotel as well
as in the shops we detect the atmosphere of our native land,
especially of San Francisco. The English give the tone to
society here, as everywhere throughout the East, and class
distinctions are more rigorously observed than in the
mother island itself. At Yokohama we seemed to meet the
blessed spring-time of the temperate zone. The day after
our arrival we took <i>jinrikishas</i> and went out into the
country-like suburbs of the city. We walked a part of the
way through rustling wheat fields, with the Peerless Mountain
in sight and the broad blue bay, dotted with ocean
steamships from all ports, and white-sailed native junks. It
was like a perfect June day at home, and after nearly a
month on shipboard the touch of the brown solid earth under
our feet was enough to make us shout for joy. The blue
violet, the wild strawberry, and even the common dandelion,
were here to greet us like old familiar friends. Birds
flew past us with happy chirp, but no song. Some critic has
said that “Japan is a country of birds without song, flowers
without perfume, and poetry without music.” But what were
these strange, weird, unearthly, mysterious melodies that
came floating down to us from the azure? We stopped our
<i>jinrikishas</i> to listen and look. There, above our heads, were
half a dozen immense kites, made of bamboo, in the shape of
winged dragons and bats, and it was an Æolian attachment
that sent down to us this music. The Greek boy sends up
his kite at night with a light attached so that it gleams like
a star through the darkness, and our patriotic member is
somewhat chagrined that the American boy should be surpassed,
even in such a juvenility as the kite, by the Greek
and Japanese! A pleasant reception by the American residents,
especially those engaged in mission work; visits to
the temples and native quarters; observation of educational
and evangelical work, carried on here by our countrymen
and women, filled our week in Yokohama. At the end of
that time we took train for Tokio, which is only one hour
distant by rail.</p>

<p>Distances are magnificent in this modern, imperial city of
Japan. Thirty-six square miles is supposed to be the extent
of Tokio, but only sixteen miles of this space are covered
with houses, while the rest is given up to parks, gardens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
and rice fields. The population is variously estimated from
800,000 to 1,500,000. One of the most interesting places to
visit in Tokio is Shiba with its tombs of the Shoguns and
Buddhist temples. There we went the morning after our
arrival. The approach to the mortuary temples of the Shoguns
is by a wide stone-paved avenue bordered on either
side by stone lanterns not more than six feet apart and of
graceful shape. We have left the bustle, noise and busy
life of the streets, and find here a restful stillness broken only
by the chirp of the sparrow and the sighing of the wind
through grand, old red cedars, called cryptomeria, which
have been growing here since the seventeenth century.
Leaving our shoes at the threshold of the temples we walked
over the highly polished, lacquered floors in our stocking
feet. Here before the shrines were gifts of the daimios,
bronzes and gold lacquer of priceless value, and we, outside
barbarians, were admitted into the holy of holies and allowed
to gaze on all this splendor and decoration without a
word of remonstrance from the young Buddhist priest in attendance,
although previous to the rebellion of 1868, only the
reigning Shogun was allowed to enter. The tomb of the Second
Shogun is in an octagonal hall richly gilt, eight pillars
covered with gilt copper plate supporting the roof. The lion
and the tree peony often appear in the carvings, the one representing
the king of beasts, the other the king of flowers.
The tomb itself stands in the center of the hall and is one of
the most magnificent specimens of gold lacquer to be seen
in Japan. The stone pedestal takes the form of the lotus,
the Buddhistic emblem of purity.</p>

<p>Oh! but how delightful it was to get out under the great
blue dome of the sky, and climb the green, sunny slopes
under the gigantic, gnarled cedars to the level plateau,
where we could look abroad over sea and land and crowded
city. The ever present tea house was close at hand, and two
Japanese maidens quickly appeared with the pale, fragrant
fluid innocent of sugar or milk, served in tiny cups with a
cherry blossom floating on the surface. We preferred the
tea without the æsthetic accompaniment, and so, with profound
bows, this tray was removed to be speedily followed
by another. While we were sipping this beverage, which
was too insipid to either cheer or inebriate, an old woman,
with a quavering voice, sang to us, accompanying herself
with a Japanese guitar called the samisen. On our way
home we peeped into a Buddhist temple where there was a
funeral service in progress. Just within the door was a
square pine box with a pole at the top so that it could be
carried by the four coolies, who sat outside eating rice
cakes, drinking tea, smoking and talking. There was no
mourner present, and indeed no person in the temple but
the young priest who was going through his perfunctory
mumblement. In our ignorance of Japanese customs we
thought this small box must contain the remains of a child,
but we were told that in this country the dead are arranged in
a sitting posture, the head bent between the knees, and therefore
the square box takes the place of the long narrow coffin.
This box contained the body of a young woman, twenty
years of age, whose friends lived too far away to be present
at the funeral, so that in this case the body was to be
burned and the ashes sent to them, although usually the
Japanese bury their dead.</p>

<p>As we rode slowly through the native quarter, looking
into the bazaars, we noticed before many of the shops and
houses bamboo poles erected, and at the top of the poles
were floating out in the breeze inflated paper fishes from
two to six feet in length. This is the beginning of the Feast
of Flags, which comes on the fifth day of the fifth month,
and is the greatest day of all the year for boys. It is really
a national celebration of the birthday of all the boys in the
kingdom, while the third day of the third month is devoted
to the girls, and is called the Feast of Dolls. The fish represented
is the carp or salmon, which is able to swim
swiftly against the current and to leap over waterfalls, and
is supposed to be typical of the youth mounting over all difficulties
to success and prosperity. We stopped at a Shinto
temple, which was covered by a roof, but it was destitute of
all decoration and symbolism, except the round mirror,
which has various meanings, one of them being that it
is a revealer of the inner character. A man came up to
worship while we stood there. He threw a small coin on
the mat within the railing, clapped his hands twice, stood
for a moment with closed eyes as though in prayer, clapped
his hands again, and it was all over.</p>

<p>At the normal school for girls, of which the empress is
patroness, the tuition is free, and pupils are here from all
parts of Japan. They are supposed to prepare themselves
for teachers, although they are not absolutely required to
pursue this vocation. The object of the school is probably
quite as much to furnish educated wives for the ambitious
young men of new Japan. Prof. Mason’s system of music
is taught here, and the piano is superceding the Japanese
instruments. Drawing is also taught after the western
methods. Instruction in needlework is given, both in plain
sewing and embroidery. Every girl is taught to cut and
make her own garments. There are no patterns used, but
it is all done according to mathematical rules, and the cloth
is so used that there is no waste in cutting. We saw a little
girl not more than ten years old draw an exact diagram on
the blackboard of the way a piece of cloth could be cut to
make an outer garment. The pupils are also taught how to
arrange flowers artistically. Here, as in the nobles’ school,
there is a teacher of etiquette, and these maidens, some of
them from the interior of the country and from poor homes,
are instructed in the manners of polite society. An interesting
department of this school is the kindergarten, where
both sexes are admitted, and we saw more than a hundred
little creatures gathered here with grave faces and long
robes, and neither from the dress nor the arrangement of the
hair could we tell the boys from the girls. Some twenty of
the children, belonging to families of wealth and position,
were accompanied by their nurses, who sat at one side.
Nearly every child had a wooden tag attached to the belt,
on which were written the name and address of the parents.
There was one handsome little fellow, whom we called the
Prince, with his head as smoothly shaven as a Buddhist
priest’s. He wore gorgeous silk robes, and moved through
his calisthenic exercises with a very complacent air. The
children who were dressed in European fashion were most
absurd looking creatures, and we much preferred to see them
in their own costume. The Japanese are such a tiny people
that, unless they have been abroad long enough to adopt our
dress and wear it with ease, they look much better in their
own flowing robes, which give grace and dignity to the figure.
We heard an amusing story of the costume in which
a native Christian appeared before the Presbytery to be ordained
as an elder. He was a private citizen, but he wore
on this occasion a blue coat with brass buttons, a buff waistcoat,
knee breeches, and high top cavalry boots with spurs,
looking as though he was about to engage in some other warfare
than spiritual.</p>

<p>The largest and most popular temple of Tokio, Asakusa,
is to that city what St. Paul’s is to London, or Notre Dame
to Paris. The avenue which leads to the temple is lined on
either side with booths, and there are gardens adjoining in
which are a variety of shows, waxworks and trained birds,
theaters and tea-houses, with swarms of disreputable characters.
The Japanese mix up the sacred and secular in a
way that is very shocking to our ideas. At one of the side
shrines in the temple is a wooden image, contact with which
is said to cure disease, and it is pathetic to see how the features
have been obliterated and the body worn as smooth as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
St. Peter’s toe at Rome by the rubbing of thousands of palms
of poor human sufferers who have hoped to find healing
power in this senseless mass of wood.</p>

<p>Near the temple is a revolving library containing a complete
edition of the Buddhist scriptures. The library looks
like a huge red lacquer lantern, some twelve feet high, on a
black lacquer base and stone lotus-shaped pedestal. The
whole structure revolves on a pivot. A ticket over the
door explains the use of this peculiar book-case, and reads
as follows: “Owing to the voluminousness of the Buddhist
scriptures—6,771 volumes—it is impossible for any single
individual to read them through; but a degree of merit
equal to that accruing to him who should have perused the
entire canon will be obtained by those who will cause this
library to revolve three times on its axis, and, moreover,
long life, prosperity and the avoidance of all misfortunes
shall be their reward.” For a small fee the custodian allows
you to gain all this merit.</p>

<p>An overland journey to Kioto, Osaka and Kobe, returning
by steamer to Yokohama, and from thence a trip to
Nikko, and the Chautauquans are ready to embark on the
<i>City of Tokio</i>, which is to take them on the long and monotonous
voyage across the Pacific. Taking the northerly
route we enter at once a belt of penetrating fog, chilling
winds and occasional showers, which make the luxurious
deck life, which we found so agreeable on the southern
seas, quite impracticable. Finding a good collection of
books in the ship’s library we still linger in the land of the
Rising Sun by reading Griffis and Satow, Miss Bird and Sir
Edward Reed. There are only twenty-six saloon passengers,
but more than a thousand Chinese are packed away in
the steerage, and they swarm on the forward deck during
the day, smoking and playing games, but more quiet and
peaceable than a quarter of that number of Irishmen would
be under similar circumstances. Nineteen days without
sight of sail or land and we rejoice to know that the shores
of America will soon be visible. San Francisco once reached,
the Chautauquans will have put the girdle round the world,
for they visited the western coast of America on the famous
Sabbath-school excursion, headed by Dr. Vincent, in 1879.
By the aid of the captain’s glass and our own opera glasses
about four o’clock on a bright, breezy afternoon, we discern
in the far eastern horizon a white, rocky island, crowned
with a light-house. Soon after another dim hint of land
appears to the north, and a little later the main land becomes
visible. Just after a glorious sunset we enter the
Golden Gate, a crescent moon hanging above the narrow
pass. Familiar objects appear—the Cliff House, the Fort—and
before we retire the great engines cease their throbbing,
the ship drops anchor, and the gleaming lights of San Francisco
welcome us home again.</p>

<p>Were it not that some few other animals seem, in a small
degree, to have somewhat of the same faculty, man might
be defined a scraping or collecting animal, for there is
scarcely an individual of the genus but manifests this peculiarity;
some in scraping or collecting for their own subsistence
or that of their offspring; many for the gratification
of their senses or intellect, irrespective of physical wants of
increase or preservation.</p>

<p>I was shown the other day a neat little cabinet, belonging
to a great traveler and naturalist, in which were labelled
and described nearly four hundred different species or varieties
of bugs! George the Fourth collected saddles. The
Princess Charlotte, and many besides, collected shells, of
which some of the ugliest, being fortunately the rarest, are
very valuable. For a very rare one, Rumfius, a collector of
old, though stone blind, is said to have given £1000. Tulips
were once a favorite subject with collectors, especially in
Holland, where the sums given for new or rare roots were
enormous. One root once sold for 4600 florins (about £370)
together with a new carriage, a pair of grey horses, and a
set of harness. Other flowers have since become favorites
in succession, as auriculas, picotees, dahlias, and now,
roses.</p>

<p>Of collections of pictures of a general character a long list
might be made, and there are in England several fine collections
of statues, ancient and modern. I don’t know,
however, that we have any such enthusiasts, as antiquaries,
as a gentleman mentioned by Evelyn, who, being at Rome
in 1644, went “to the house of Hippolite Vitellesco (afterwards
Bibliothecary of ye Vatican Library) who show’d us
one of the best collections of statues in Rome, to which he
frequently talks as if they were living, pronouncing now
and then orations, sentences, and verses, sometimes kissing
and embracing them. He has a head of Brutus, scarred in
the face by order of the Senate for killing Julius; this is
much esteemed.” Special collections of portraits do not
however seem to have met with much favor. One of the
earliest collectors in England was William, Earl of Pembroke,
of the time of James the First, who was quite famous
as a physiognomist, and who formed a special collection of
portraits at Wilton. General Fairfax is said to have collected
portraits of warriors; and a few others might be named as
having added to their own family portraits those of their
friends, or of persons whose position or talents rendered
them celebrated. But it was reserved for Lord Chancellor
Clarendon to form the first important collection of English
worthies. When he built his grand house in Piccadilly, he
appears to have arranged a gallery of portraits on a well-considered
plan. They were limited to those of eminent
men of his own country, but not restricted to any particular
class. This collection of portraits was already very extensive
when Clarendon went into exile, and he was then
getting a long list from Evelyn in order to add to it. In a
letter to Pepys, and in his “Numismata,” Evelyn enumerates,
from memory, nearly a hundred illustrious Englishmen
whose portraits he had seen at Clarendon House, and
which were afterwards removed to Cornbury in Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>Next to a gallery of portraits in oil, must be reckoned a
cabinet of miniatures, and indeed if these are by masters like
Oliver and Cooper and Petitôt, they are of equal value, both
as portraits and pictures, with the larger works. But now,
nearly all the works of these celebrated artists are gathered
into collections such as that of the Duke of Buccleugh,
whence no collector can hope to charm them, charm he
never so wisely. The first large collection of miniatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
formed was that of Walpole. Until recently few persons
sought for more than family portraits, or those of friends,
and Walpole was enabled therefore to form his matchless
collection of miniatures with comparative ease and at a comparatively
moderate expense. At that time, he says, they
were “superior to any other collection whatever,” and particularly
as regards the works of Peter and Isaac Oliver,
“the best extant, and as perfect as when they came from the
hand of the painter.”</p>

<p>To collect all the portraits that have ever been engraved is
of course a hopeless task, and there would necessarily be so
many important hiatuses, that no one probably now-a-days
will enter on the undertaking. Yet it was attempted, and
it must have been an exciting occupation, too serious for
an amusement or recreation, for the several collectors, who
then all ran for the same goal, to outdo and outbid each
other in forming their collections. It is astonishing how
interesting a collection may be made of portraits of a more
limited range. Walpole’s Royal and Noble Authors, or
Lodge’s Memoirs, are more readable than the Biographia
Britannica, or Bayle’s Dictionary; and two or three folios
of portraits of a particular class, or of a particular era, well
arranged and annotated may be made much more amusing,
recreative, and interesting than dozens of cabinets filled
with a miscellaneous assemblage of portraits of people of all
sorts who have lived “everywhen” and everywhere. The
collector may himself make a book by collecting some series
of portraits, as of statesmen, poets, actors, etc., etc., of some
particular period, and placing opposite to each a few salient
biographical paragraphs. A few dates should be given, as
of birth, death, etc., but no attempt need be made to furnish
a full biography. It should be endeavored rather to heighten
our interest in the portrait by recalling or recording a few
anecdotes, than to attempt to vie with a biographical dictionary.
Just as in passing along a gallery of portraits, or
noticing those in a great house, we pause not only to criticise
the figure, or the complexion and expression of the face,
but to remark such and such an event in the life of him or
her who is before us. What is wanted in these inscriptions
is not a serious biography of the individual, but, besides a
few special facts and dates, some short characteristic anecdotes
not generally met with in biographies, but to be picked
up in “<i>Memoires pour servir</i>”—and similar ana.</p>

<p>Almost the first great or systematic collectors of engraved
portraits in England were Evelyn and Pepys; the former
having the start. It was not till about 1668 that Pepys began
collecting portraits, getting many of Nanteuil, etc.,
from France, and being helped with the advice of Evelyn,
as well as with specimens from his collection. In 1669 he
went to France, and doubtless collected there many things
(which are now in the Pepysian Library) on the recommendation
of his friend, who says in one of his letters at
this time, printed by Lord Braybrooke, “They will greatly
refresh you in your study, and by your fireside, when you
are many years returned.”</p>

<p>Yes, they will indeed refresh you! This is one of the great
charms of such reminiscences of travel, that when you
come home you are constantly traveling again in looking
over sketches, pictures, and books. You see an engraving
of the Madonna della Sedia, and away you are at once,
quicker than the telegraph, to Florence the Fair, and to
that sunny day, when crossing the Arno by the Ponte
Vecchio, you first came to the Palazzo Pitti, and, passing
by wonders and wonders of art, you stopped at last by <i>the</i>
Raffaelle and forgot the world, absorbed by that which is
indeed “a joy forever.” In the same way you turn over a
folio of portraits. Here are Elizabeth, Leicester, Raleigh,
Shakspere, Melville, and Mary of Scots—and you walk
about London and Greenwich, and visit the world of three
hundred years ago! Or you take up a folio of a later period,
where are Charles the Second, Buckingham, Rochester,
Grammont, Sedley, Killigrew, York, Clarendon, Dryden,
Lely, Castlemaine, Stewart, Nelly, and the Queen—and you
are dining at one o’clock with the learned Mr. Evelyn and
the wondrous Pepys, talking and telling anecdotes (with a
good deal of relish) of the bad goings on of those times, A.
D. 1666. Or, whisking out another folio, you rush off to Sir
Joshua Reynolds’s and laugh and criticise, mourn and moralize
with Goldsmith, Johnson, Burke, and Garrick, and
think of Hogarth “over the way,” and of Chesterfield, Walpole,
the Gunnings, Kitty Clive, Nelly O’Brien, and many
more who have, unconsciously to themselves and to us,
moved the world a step forward. These are among the
charms, the pleasures and advantages of collections of portraits.</p>

<h2><a name="RESULTS_OF_THE_DISCOVERY_OF" id="RESULTS_OF_THE_DISCOVERY_OF">RESULTS OF THE DISCOVERY OF
AMERICA.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By JOHN LORD, LL.D.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The <i>material</i> consequences of the discovery of America
were brilliant and important. They first stimulated the
passion for further explorations, and among all the maritime
nations of Europe. Hence the voyages of Ojeda, of Nino,
of Puiza, of Balboa, of Vespucci, of Cabot, of Raleigh, and
various other men of enterprise. They did not rest until
they had explored the coasts and rivers of the whole American
continent, north and south. The Spaniards took the
lead, and, following in their steps, the Portuguese doubled
the Cape of Good Hope, and established their factories in
the islands of the Indian Ocean. The Dutch and English
were animated by the same zeal, until the East and West
Indies were known to travelers and merchants. The French
missionaries explored the wilds of the North, and sailed
down the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence. In a few years
the grand outlines of North and South America were known
to geographical scholars. A new world was opened to the
enterprise of Europeans. Then followed the conquest of
such parts of America as stimulated the ambition and avarice
of the Europeans, especially of Spain, who claimed the
quarter part of the American continent. These conquests
were atrocious, from the cruelties inflicted on the unsuspecting
natives, to whom the country belonged. The discovery
of the precious metals in Brazil, Peru, and Mexico,
and the repute of their abundance, was the cause of these
conquests.</p>

<p>At last followed colonization, not so much with a view of
permanent settlement or agricultural improvements, as the
desire and hope of getting rich in the mines. Colonization
had no dignity until the English settled in Virginia and in
New England. Gold was the first stimulus, a fertile country
the second, and religious liberty the third. The views
of those who colonized Virginia were different from those
who landed on Plymouth Rock. But all the colonists
doubtless sought to improve their condition; and for two
hundred years and more the stream of emigration has flowed
toward the West. The poor, the miserable, as well as the
intelligent and enterprising in all parts of Europe, have regarded
America as a refuge and a home.</p>

<p>We next notice an amazing stimulus to commerce, and the
enrichment of Spain by the possession of the new mines of
silver and gold. Wealth flowed in a steady stream to Spain,
and that country became the richest and most powerful in
Europe. The Spanish navy became the greatest in the
world, and Spain prospered beyond all precedent.</p>

<p>Another interesting inquiry arises, how far the nations
of Europe were really enriched by the rapid accumulation
of gold and silver. The search for the precious metals
may have stimulated commercial enterprise, but it is not so
clear that they added to the substantial wealth of Europe,
except so far as they promoted industry. Gold is not wealth;
it is the exponent of wealth. Real wealth is in farms, and
shops, and ships—in the various channels of industry, in
the results of human labor.</p>

<p>So far as the precious metals enter into useful manufactures,
or into articles of beauty and taste, they are indeed
inherently valuable. Mirrors, plate, jewelry, watches, gilded
furniture, the adornments of the person, in an important
sense constitute wealth, since all nations value them and
will pay for them as they do for corn and oil. So far as they
are connected with art, they are valuable in the same sense
as statues and pictures on which labor has been expended.
There is something useful and even necessary besides food
and raiment and houses. The gold which ornamented
Solomon’s temple, or the Minerva of Phidias, or the garments
of Leo X., had a value. The ring which is a present
to brides is a part of a marriage ceremony. The gold watch,
which never tarnishes, is more valuable inherently than a
pewter one, because it remains beautiful. Then when gold
enters into ornaments, deemed indispensable, or into manufactures
which are needed, it has an inherent value. It is
wealth. But when it is a mere medium of exchange—its chief
use—then it has only a conventional value. I mean it does not
make a nation rich or poor, since the rarer it is the more it
will purchase of the necessities of life. A pound weight of
gold in ancient Greece, or in mediæval Europe, would purchase
as much wheat as twenty pounds weight would purchase
to-day. If the mines of Mexico, or Peru, or California
had never been worked, the gold in the civilized world three
hundred years ago would have been as valuable for banking
purposes, or as an exchange for agricultural products, as
twenty times its present quantity, since it would have
bought as much as twenty times the quantity would buy to-day.
Make diamonds as plenty as crystals, they would be
worth no more than crystals, if they were not harder and
more beautiful than crystals. Make gold as plenty as silver,
it would be worth no more than silver, except for manufacturing
purposes. It would be worth no more than silver to
bankers and merchants. The vast increase in the production
of the precious metals simply increased the value of
the commodities for which they were exchanged. A laborer
can purchase no more bread with a dollar to-day than he
could with five cents three hundred years ago. Five cents
were really as much wealth three hundred years ago as a
dollar is to-day. Wherein, then, has the increase in the
precious metals added to the wealth of the world, if a twentieth
part of the gold and silver now in circulation would
buy as much land, or furniture, or wheat, or oil, three hundred
years ago, as twenty times the quantity of gold and
silver would buy to-day? Had no gold or silver mines been
discovered in America, the gold and silver would have appreciated
in value in proportion to the wear of them. In
other words, the scarcer the gold and silver the more the
same will purchase of the fruits of human industry. So industry
is the wealth, not the gold. It is the cultivated farms
and the manufactures, and the buildings, and the internal
improvements of a country, which constitute its real wealth,
since they represent its industry—the labor of men.</p>

<p>Mines indeed employ the labor of men, but they do not
furnish food for the body, or raiment to wear, or houses to
live in, or fuel for cooking, or for any purpose whatever of
human comfort or necessity—only material for ornament,
which I grant is wealth so far as ornament is for the welfare
of man. The marbles of ancient Greece are very valuable
for the labor expended on them either for architecture or
ornament.</p>

<p>Gold and silver were early selected as a useful and convenient
article of exchange, like bank notes, and so have
inherent value as they supply that necessity, but if a quarter
part of the gold and silver in existence would supply that
necessity, the remaining three-fourths would be as inherently
valueless as the paper on which bank notes are engraved.
Value consists in what they represent of the labors
and industries of men.</p>

<p>Now Spain ultimately became poor, in spite of the influx
of gold and silver from the American mines, because industries
of all kinds declined. People were diverted from
useful callings by the mighty delusion which gold discoveries
created. These discoveries had the same effect on industry,
which is the wealth of nations, as the support of
standing armies in our day. They diverted men from legitimate
callings. The miners had to be supported like soldiers,
and the sudden influx of gold and silver, intoxicated
men and stimulated speculation. An army of speculators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
does not enrich a nation, since they rob each other.
They earn money to change hands. They do not stimulate
industry. They do not create wealth, they simply make it
flow from one person to another.</p>

<p>But speculations sometimes create activity in enterprise.
They inflame desire for wealth and cause people to make
greater exertions. In that sense, the discovery of American
mines gave a stimulus to commerce and travel and energy.
People rushed to America for gold. Those people
had to be fed and clothed. Then farmers and manufacturers
followed the gold-hunters. They tilled the soil to feed
the mines. The new farms which dotted the region of the
gold diggers added to the wealth of the country in which
the mines were located. Colonization followed gold-digging.
But it was America that became enriched, not the old
countries from which the miners came, except so far as the
old countries furnished tools and ships and fabrics. Doubtless
commerce and manufactures were stimulated. So far
the wealth of the world increased. But the men who returned
to riot in luxury and idleness did not stimulate enterprise.
They made others idle also. The necessity of labor
was lost sight of.</p>

<p>And yet if one country became idle, another country may
have become industrious. There can be but little question
that the discovery of American mines gave commerce and
manufactures and agriculture, on the whole, a stimulus.
This was particularly seen in England. England grew
rich from industry and enterprise, as Spain became poor
from idleness and luxury. The silver and gold, diffused
through Europe, ultimately found their way into the pockets
of Englishmen who made a market of their manufactures.
It was not the precious metals which enriched England, but
those articles of industry for which the rest of the world
parted with their gold and silver. What has made France
rich since the revolution? Those innumerable articles of
taste and elegance, fabrics for which all Europe parted
with its specie, not war, not conquest, not mines. Why,
till recently, was Germany so poor?—because it had so little
to sell to other nations—because industry was cramped by
standing armies and despotic government.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, that the discovery of America opened
a new field for industry and enterprise to all the discontented
and impoverished and oppressed Europeans who emigrated.
At first they emigrated to dig silver and gold.
The opening of mines required labor, and miners were
obliged to part with their gold for the necessities of life.
Thus California, in our day, has become peopled with farmers
and merchants and manufacturers as well as miners.
Many came to America expecting to find gold and were disappointed
and were obliged to turn agriculturists, as in Virginia.
Many came to New England from political and religious
motives. But all came to better their fortunes.
Gradually the United States and Canada became populated
from east to west, and from north to south. The surplus
population of Europe poured itself into the wilds of America.
Generally the emigrants were farmers. With the
growth of agricultural industry was developed commerce
and manufactures. Thus, materially, the world was immensely
benefited. A new continent was opened for industry.
No matter what the form of government may be—I
might almost say no matter what the morals and religion
of the people may be—so long as there is land to occupy,
and to be sold cheap, the continent will fill up, and will be
as densely populated as Europe or Asia, because the natural
advantages are good. The rivers and the lakes will be navigated.
The products of the country will be exchanged for
European and Asiatic products. Wealth will certainly increase,
and increase indefinitely.</p>

<p>There is no calculating the future greatness and wealth of
the new world, especially in the United States. There are
no bounds to commerce, manufactures, and agricultural
products. We can predict with certainty the rise of new
cities, villas, palaces, material splendor limited only to the
increasing resources and population of the country. Who
can tell the number of miles of new railroads yet to be
made, the new inventions to abridge human labor? What
great empires are destined to rise! What unknown forms of
luxury will be found out! What new and magnificent trophies
of art and science will gradually be seen! What
mechanisms, what material glories are sure to come! This
is not speculation. Nothing can retard the growth of America
in material wealth and glory. The tower of the new
Babel will rise to the clouds, and be seen in all its glory
throughout the earth and sea. No Fourth of July orator
ever exaggerated the future destinies of America in a material
point of view. No “spread eagle” politician ever conceived
what is sure to come.</p>

<p>And what then? Grant the most indefinite expansion—the
growth of empires whose splendor and wealth and
power shall utterly eclipse the glories of the old world. All
this is probable. But when we have dwelt on the future
material expansion—when we have given wings to imagination,
and feel that even imagination can not reach the
probable realities, in a material aspect, then our predictions
and calculations stop. Beyond material glories we can not
count with certainty.</p>

<p>The world has witnessed many powerful empires which
have passed away, “leaving scarcely a wreck behind.”
What remains of the antediluvian world? Not even a spike
of Noah’s Ark, larger and stronger than any modern ship.
What remains of Babylon, of Thebes, of Tyre, of Carthage—those
great cities of wealth and power? What remains
of Roman greatness, even, except in laws and literature, and
renovated statues? Remember, there is an undeviating
uniformity in the past history of nations. What is the simple
story of all the ages?—industry, wealth, corruption, decay
and ruin. What conservative power has been strong
enough to arrest the ruin of the nations of antiquity? Have
not material forces and glories been developed and exhibited,
whatever the religion and morals of the fallen nations?
Can not a country grow materially to a point under the most
adverse influence in a religious and moral point of view?
Yet for lack of religion and morals the nations perished, and
their Babel towers were buried in the dust. They perished
for lack of true conservative forces—at least that is the
judgment of historians. Nobody doubts the splendor of the
material glories of the ancient nations. The ruins of Baalbec,
of Palmyra, of Athens, prove this, to say nothing of
history. The material glories of the ancient nations may
be surpassed by our modern wonders, but yet all the material
glories of the ancient nations passed away.</p>

<p>Now, if this is to be the destiny of America—an unbounded
material growth, followed by corruption and ruin, then Columbus
has simply extended the realm for men to try material
experiments. Make New York a second Carthage,
and Boston a second Athens, and Philadelphia a second Antioch,
and Washington a second Rome, and we simply repeat
the old experiment. Did not the Romans have nearly
all we have, materially, except our modern scientific inventions?
But has America no higher destiny than to repeat
the old experiments, and improve upon them and become
rich and powerful? Has she no higher and nobler mission?
Can she lay hold of forces that the old world never had,
such as will prevent the uniform doom of nations? I maintain
that there is no reason that can be urged, based on history
and experience, why she should escape the fate of the
nations of antiquity, unless new forces arise on this continent,
different from what the world has known, and which
have a conservative influence. If America has a great mission
to declare and to fulfill, she must put forth altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
new forces, and they not material. That alone will save
her, and save the world. It is mournful to contemplate
even the future material glories of America, if they are not
to be preserved—if these are to share the fate of ancient
wonders. It is obvious that the real glory of America is to
be something entirely different from that of which the ancients
boasted. And this is to be to the moral and spiritual,
that which the ancients lacked. And this leads me to speak
of the moral consequences of the discovery of America—infinitely
grander than any material wonders, of which the
world has been full, of which nearly every form of paganism
has boasted, and which must necessarily perish, everywhere,
without new forces to preserve them. In a moral
point of view scarcely anything good resulted, at least to
Europe, by the discovery of America. It excited the wildest
spirit of adventure, the most unscrupulous cupidity, the
most demoralizing speculations. It created jealousies and
wars. The cruelties and injustices inflicted on the Indians
were revolting. Nothing in the annals of the world exceeded
the wickednesses of the Spaniards in the conquest of
Peru and Mexico. That conquest is the most dismal and
least glorious in human history. We see no poetry or heroism
or necessity. We read of nothing but crimes. The
Jesuits, in their missionary zeal, partly redeemed the cruelties,
but they soon imposed a despotic yoke and made their
religion pay. Monopolies scandalously increased, and the
New World was regarded only as spoil. The tone of moral
feeling was lowered everywhere, for the natives were crazed
with the hope of sudden accumulation. Spain became
enervated and demoralized.</p>

<p>On America itself the demoralization was even more
marked. There never was such a state of moral degradation
in any Christian country as in South America. Three
centuries have passed, and the low state of morals continues.
Contrast Mexico and Peru with the United States,
morally and intellectually. What seeds of vice did not the
Spaniards plant! How the old natives melted away!</p>

<p>And then, to add to the moral evils attending colonization,
is the introduction of African slaves, especially in
the West Indies and the Southern States. Christendom
seems to have lost the seed of morality. Slavery more than
counterbalances all other advantages together. It was the
stain of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Not
merely slavery but the slave trade increases the horror of
the frightful picture. America became associated, in the
minds of Europeans, with gold hunting, slavery, and cruelty
to Indians. Better that the country remained undiscovered
than the introduction of such vices and miseries in
the most fertile part of the New World.</p>

<p>I can not see that civilization gained anything, morally,
by the discovery of America, until the new settlers were
animated by other motives than a desire of sudden wealth.
When the country became colonized by men who sought
liberty to worship God, men of lofty purposes, willing to
undergo sufferings and danger in order to plant the seeds of
a higher civilization, then there arose new forms of social
and political life. Such men were those who colonized New
England. And say what you will, in spite of all the disagreeable
side of the Puritan character, it was the Puritans
who gave a new impulse to civilization in its higher sense.
They founded schools and colleges and churches. They introduced
a new form of political life by their town meetings,
in which liberty was nurtured, and all social improvements
were regulated; it was the autonomy of towns on
which the political structure rested. In them was born that
true representative government which has gradually spread
toward the West. The colonies were embryo states, states
afterward to be bound together by a stronger tie than that
of a league.</p>

<p>The New England States, since the War of Independence,
were the defenders and advocates of a central power. An
entirely new political organization gradually was formed,
resting equally on such pillars as independent townships
and independent states, and these represented by delegates
in a national center.</p>

<p>So we believe America was discovered not so much to furnish
a field for indefinite material expansion, with European
arts and fashions, which would simply assimilate
America with the old world, with all its dangers and vices
and follies, as to introduce new forms of government, new
social institutions, new customs and manners, new experiments
in liberty, new religious organizations, new modes
to ameliorate the necessary evils of life. It was discovered
that men might labor and employ the fruits of industry in
a new mode, unfettered by the slaveries which the institutions
of Europe imposed. America was a new field to try experiments
in government and social life, which could not be
tried in other nations without sweeping and dangerous revolutions.
And new institutions have arisen which are our
pride and boast, and which are the wonder and admiration
of Europe. America is the only country under the sun
in which there is self-government—a government which
purely represents the wisdom of the people, where universal
suffrage is not a mockery—and if America has a destiny
to fulfill for other nations, she must give them something
more valuable than reaping machines, palace cars and horse
railroads. She must give, not machinery to abridge labor,
but institutions and ideas to expand the mind and elevate
the soul—something by which the poor can rise and assert
their rights. Unless something is developed here which
can not be developed in other countries in the way of new
spiritual and intellectual forces which have a conservative
influence, then I can not see how America can long continue
to be the home and refuge of the poor and miserable
of other lands. A new and better spirit must vivify schools
and colleges and philanthropic enterprises than that which
has prevailed in older nations. Unless something new is
born here which has a peculiar power to save, wherein will
America ultimately differ from other parts of Christendom?
We must have schools in which the heart as well as the
brain is educated, and newspapers which aspire to something
higher than to fan prejudices and appeal to perverted
tastes. Our hope is not in books which treat infidelity under
the name of science; not in pulpits which can not be
sustained without sensational oratory; not in journals
which trade on the religious sentiments of the people; nor
Sabbath-school books which are an insult to the human understanding;
nor colleges which fit youth merely for making
money; nor schools of technology to give an impulse to
material interests; nor legislatures controlled by monopolists;
nor judges elected by demagogues; nor philanthropic
societies to ventilate impractical theories. These will
neither renovate nor conserve what is most precious in life.
Unless a nation grows morally as well as materially, there
is something wrong at the core of society. As I have said,
no material expansion will avail if society becomes rotten
at the core. America is a glorious boon to civilization, but
only as she fulfills a new mission in history—not to become
more potent in material forces, but in those spiritual agencies
which prevent corruption and decay. An infidel professor
calling himself a <i>savant</i>, may tell you that there is
nothing certain or great but in the direction of science to
utilities, even as he may boast in a philosophy which ignores
a creator and takes cognizance only of a creation. As
I survey the growing and enormous moral evils which degrade
society here as everywhere, in spite of Bunker Hills
and Plymouth Rocks, and all the advance in useful mechanisms,
I am sometimes tempted to propound inquiries
which suggest the old mournful story of the decline and
ruin of states and empires. I ask myself “Why will America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
be an exception to the uniform fate of nations, as history
has demonstrated? why should not good institutions be
presented here as in all other countries and ages of the
world?” When has civilization shown any striking triumph
except in inventions to abridge the labor of mankind and
make men comfortable and rich? Is there nothing before
us then but the triumph of material life, to end as mournfully
as the materialism of antiquity? If so, then Christianity
is a most dismal failure, is a defeated power, like all
other forms of religion which failed to save. But is it a failure?
Are we really swinging back to paganism? Is the
time to be hailed when all religions will be considered by the
philosopher as equally false and equally useful? Is there
nothing more cheerful for us to contemplate than what the
old pagan philosophy holds out,—man destined to live like
brutes or butterflies, and pass away into the infinity of time
and space, like inert matter, decomposed, absorbed, and entering
into new and everlasting combination? Is America
to become like Europe and Asia in all essential elements of
life? Has she no other mission than to add to perishable glories?
Is she to teach the world nothing new in education, and
philanthropy, and government? Are all her struggles in
behalf of liberty in vain? Is Christianity to move round
her in circles of milliners and upholsterers, and fanaticisms,
and dogmatisms, and superstitions?</p>

<p>We all know that Christianity is the only hope of the
world. The question is whether America is, or is not, more
favorable for its healthy development and application than
the other countries of Christendom. We believe that it is. If
it is not, then America is only a new field for the spread and
triumph of material forces. If it is, we may look forward
to such improvements in education, in political institutions,
in social life, in religious organizations, in philanthropical
enterprise, that the country will be sought by the poor
and enslaved classes of Europe, more for its moral and intellectual
advantages, than for mines or farms, and the objects
of the Puritan settlers will be gained.</p>

<h2><a name="JOYS_OF_HIGH_COMPANIONSHIP" id="JOYS_OF_HIGH_COMPANIONSHIP">JOYS OF HIGH COMPANIONSHIP.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By ARTHUR HELPS.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The joys, not merely of high companionship, but of any
companionship that is tolerably pleasant, are so great, that
a man with whom all other things go ill, can not be classed
as an unhappy man, if he has throughout his life much of
this pleasant companionship.</p>

<p>The desire for companionship is absolutely universal.
Even misanthropy is but the desire for companionship,
turned sour. This desire extends throughout creation. It
is very noticeable in domestic animals; and could we fathom
the causes of their sociability, we should probably have arrived
at a solution of several important questions relating
to them and to ourselves.</p>

<p>The most fascinating people in the world have, I believe,
been simply good companions. Shakspere, as he knew
most things, knew this, and has shown that he knew it, in
what he has indicated to us of the loves of Brutus and Portia,
of Antony and Cleopatra, and of Rosalind and Orlando.</p>

<p>I think it must be admitted that one of the main objects
of life is good companionship. “What,” says Emerson, “is
the end of all this apparatus of living—what but to get a
number of persons who shall be happy in each other’s society,
and be seated at the same table?”</p>

<p>The first thing for companionship is, that there should be
a good relation between the persons who are to become
good companions to each other. It is not well to use a foreign
phrase if it can be avoided, but there are foreign
phrases which are supremely significant, and utterly untranslatable.
I therefore say that those people I have
spoken of should be <i>en rapport</i> with one another. This
<i>rapport</i> may have its existence in various ways. The relationship
of mother and son, of father and daughter, will
give it; the love that some people have for children will
give it with children; similar bringing up at school or at
college may give it; similarity of present pursuits may give
it. But before all and above all, that incomprehensible, unfathomable
thing called personal liking—that which you
feel (or the contrary of which you feel), frequently at first
sight—will be sure to give it. We use the phrase “falling
in love:” we might perhaps use the phrase “falling in liking”
to describe a similar unavoidable precipitancy.</p>

<p>The beginning once made, the basis once laid for this
companionship, what are the qualities which tend to make
it continuously pleasant?</p>

<p>The first thing is confidence. Now, in using the word
confidence, it is not meant to imply that there is an absolute
necessity for much confidingness in small things. Wilhelm
von Humboldt has expressed an opinion which is
worth noting in reference to this subject. “Friendship and
love,” he says, “require the deepest and most genuine confidence,
but lofty souls do not require the trivial confidences
of familiarity.”</p>

<p>The kind of confidence that Humboldt means, and which
is required for companionship as well as for friendship and
love, puts aside all querulous questions as to whether the
companions like one another as much to-day as they did
yesterday. Steadfastness is to be assumed. And, also a
certain unchangeableness. “He is a wonderfully agreeable
person,” said a neighbor of one of the best talkers of the
day; “but I have to renew my acquaintance with him every
morning.” That good talker can not be held to be a good
companion in a high sense of the word. Again, this steadfastness
makes allowance for all variations of humor, temperament,
and fortune. It prevents one companion from
attributing any change that there may be in the other, of
manner, of bearing, or of vivacity, to a change in the real
relation between the companions. He does not make any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
of these things personal towards himself. Silence is not
supposed to be offence. Hence there is no occasion to make
talk, a thing which is fatal to companionship. One reason
why some of us enjoy so much the society of animals, is because
we need not talk to them if we do not like. And,
indeed, with a thoroughly good human companion, you
ought to be able to feel as if you were quite alone.</p>

<p>Difference of temperament is no hindrance whatever to
companionship. Indeed, the world has generally recognized
that fact. We all know that the ardent and the timid,
the hopeful and the despondent, the eager and the apathetic,
get on very well together. What may not always have been
as clearly perceived is, that there are certain diversities of
nature, chiefly relating to habits, which produce, not agreeable
contrasts, but downright fatal discords. And, in such
cases, companionship of a high kind is hopeless.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the principal requisites for companionship
have been attained; first, the basis for it created by
personal liking, early association, similarity of pursuits,
and the like; secondly, the means of continuing it, such as
this confidence that has been spoken of, the absence of contravening
tastes, the absence of unreasonable expectation,
and the like. Now, for what remain to be considered as the
essential requisites for high companionship, we must enter
into what is almost purely intellectual. For this high companionship
there must be an interest in many things, at
least on one side, and on the other a great power of receptivity.
It is almost impossible to exaggerate the needfulness
of these elements. Look at results. Consider the
nature of those men and women whom you have found,
if I may use the phrase, to be splendid companions. It is
not exactly their knowledge that has made them so; it is
their almost universal interest in everything that comes
before them. This quality will make even ignorant people
extremely good companions to the most instructed persons.
It is not, however, the relation of tutor to pupil that is contemplated
here. That is certainly not the highest form of
companionship. The kind of ignorant person that I mean,
if he or she should be one of the companions, is to be intensely
receptive and appreciative, and his or her remarks
are very dear and very pleasant to the most instructed person.
Is not the most valuable part of all knowledge very
explicable, and do you not find that you can make your best
thoughts intelligible, if you have any clearness of expression,
to persons not exactly of your own order, if you will
only take the pains to do so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruskin and Whistler.</span>—A good deal of amusement
was created by an account that on one occasion a picture of
Mr. Whistler’s was publicly produced, and neither judge
nor jury could tell which was the top and which the bottom.
Whether the legend is true or not we are in no position
to say; but it is certainly as true as the coincidence is
curious that at the Winter Exhibition of the Society of
Painters in Water-Colors, 1873-74, a lovely and elaborate
architectural drawing by Mr. Ruskin was placed upside
down. Thus it remained for a time, until some sharp-sighted
visitor discovered the fact. The work was No. 105,
“Study of the Colors of Marble in the Apse of the Duomo of
Pisa,” and exhibited with “Study of the Colors of Marble
in the Base of the Church of St. Anastasia at Verona,” No.
97. There is a third story to a similar effect. When John
Martin had finished his well-known “Zadok in Search of
the Waters of Oblivion,” which was more than once engraved,
he sent for the framemaker’s men to frame it, and
having occasion to remain in a room adjoining his studio
while they were in the latter room, he was edified by a loud
dispute between the men as to which was the top, which
the bottom of his picture.</p></div>

<h2><a name="EGYPT_FOR_THE_EGYPTIANS" id="EGYPT_FOR_THE_EGYPTIANS">EGYPT FOR THE EGYPTIANS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Judge</span> G. M. BARBER.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />


<p>“Egypt for the Egyptians!” was the motto of the
national party in their attempted revolution. What is
Egypt, and who are the Egyptians? Let history answer.
Modern investigations and the translation of hieroglyphics
and inscriptions found in tombs carry back the evidences of
its existence as a nation at least a thousand years prior to
the period fixed by the translators of the Mosaic record for
the creation of man. During all these cycles of ages these
wonderful people have maintained their existence along the
narrow region watered and enriched by the Nile. Neither
pestilence nor famine, invasion and subjugation by other
peoples, nor internal discord, has supplanted them by other
or different races; nor have they been allured to abandon
the homes of their ancestors for more fruitful lands or mineral
wealth, or commercial advantages. Although in turn
they have been conquerors, and held in subjection other
lands and other peoples, and have been themselves the conquered
and compelled to bear the yoke of people more powerful
than themselves, they have remained the same simple
agricultural people, among whom have always existed types
of squalid poverty and luxurious wealth, self-sacrificing
devotion to a religion, and the most wanton lasciviousness:
the most deplorable ignorance and the most exalted scientific
knowledge and mechanical skill.</p>

<p>Over this interesting country and people Mohammedanism
has for several centuries spread its baleful influence,
keeping out the light of Christianity and western civilization.
During most of the time since 1517 it has been under
the dominion of Turkey. In the early part of the eighteenth
century the Mamelukes, who constituted the military under
Ali Bey, threw off the Turkish yoke and maintained their
independence until the invasion by Napoleon in 1798, who
conquered it for the French and held it until 1801, when
Mehemet Ali became Pasha. After restoring tranquility
by a treacherous assassination of five hundred Mamelukes,
and the expulsion of the remainder from the country, he
turned his arms against Turkey, conquered Syria and a
great part of Asia Minor, and was in a fair way to capture
Constantinople when the European powers, England,
France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria, interfered and compelled
him to make peace with the sultan. This was in
1833. In 1839 the sultan sent an army of 80,000 men and a
large fleet to retake Ali’s conquests. This army was defeated
and the fleet surrendered to Ali and was brought to
Alexandria. The powers of Europe again interfered to
prevent the overthrow and destruction of the Turkish Empire,
England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, taking sides
with Turkey, while France, under Thiers, favored Ali.
England, however, sent a fleet, blockaded Alexandria,
bombarded and captured Beyrut and Acre, and compelled
Ali to accept peace, dictated by the allies, and to accept the
pashalic of Egypt, guaranteed to him and his descendants
on condition of his paying one-fourth of his clear revenues
to the sultan.</p>

<p>This short history is necessary to understand the relation
of Egypt to Turkey, and how the European powers have
come to take part in the affairs of Egypt. Mehemet Ali
became ruler of Egypt in 1805, under the title of pasha.
Finding his ambition to conquer Turkey frustrated by the
European powers, he attempted to introduce into the administration
of his government European systems and the
institutions of western civilization. He was succeeded by
his eldest son, Ibrahim, who lived but two months, and was
followed by his nephew, Abbas, and after six years reign of
Abbas by Saïd, the fourth son of Ali, who had a prosperous
reign of nine years and was succeeded in January, 1863, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
Ismaïl Pasha, the son of Ibrahim. The policy of modernizing
Egypt, inaugurated by Mehemet Ali, was followed by
Saïd, although wholly neglected during the unsatisfactory
rule of Abbas.</p>

<p>Ismaïl was educated in France, and had imbibed as thoroughly
as his grandfather, Mehemet, western ideas, and as
fully appreciated the superiority of European civilization
over eastern opulence and luxury. His ambition was
to accomplish what Mehemet had been prevented from accomplishing
by the interference of the European powers—to
be independent of Turkey. He seems to have had the
idea that he could at once lift Egypt from its condition of
semi-barbarism into the civilization of the nineteenth century.
The public works which he constructed must have
appeared to his simple agricultural people more wonderful
than a realization of the stories of the Arabian Nights. He
built railroads and telegraphs, constructed harbors and
wharfs for the largest vessels, and opened Alexandria to the
commerce of the world. He lighted his cities with gas,
and supplied them with water by means of aqueducts, constructed
canals for irrigation, built bridges, established military
schools, and increased his army until it excited the
jealousy of Turkey. In addition to all these he paid nearly
one-half the cost of constructing the Suez Canal, from which
there is scarcely a maritime nation in the world that does
not reap greater benefit than Egypt. The expenditures
for these improvements not only absorbed his revenues, but
involved him in enormous debts. Soon he was unable to
pay interest, and at once European capitalists refused to
make additional loans, and demanded payment. In his extreme
need of money he sold his shares of stock in the Suez
Canal, 177,000 shares, to the English government for £4,000,000.
Every dollar that could be raised by taxation was
taken from the property owners and the poor fellahs; and
when he could get no more he resorted to the “Muskabala”
policy, which consisted in giving immunity for all time
from land taxes on the payment by the owner of an agreed
assessment; one of the most short sighted pieces of statesmanship
ever devised, to sell immunity to the rich at the
expense of the poor. The finances fell into a state of inextricable
confusion. Ismaïl had no definite knowledge of his
indebtedness or of his resources. In this dilemma he applied
to the English government, which sent him two eminent
financiers, who investigated his financial condition,
and reported the public debt to be £91,000,000, or nearly
$500,000,000, and recommended a consolidated loan on bonds
at reduced interest. This project was opposed by the other
European powers, and it failed. An arrangement was
finally agreed upon which satisfied all parties. A comptroller-general
of the revenue and a comptroller-general of
the debt and audit were to be appointed, one by the English
and one by the French governments, who should have entire
control of the public revenue, its collection and application
to the payment of the expenses of the government
and the interest and principal of the public debt. The personal
creditors of the khedive also demanded an investigation
of his personal indebtedness and resources, and the
adoption of measures which should bring his expenditures
within his resources, and provide for the payment of his
debts. A commission was appointed, of which M. De Lesseps
was president, consisting of representatives of France,
England, Germany, Austria and Italy.</p>

<p>This commission reported the khedive’s personal indebtedness
to be £6,744,000, and that his resources were wholly
insufficient to pay his current expenses and the interest,
and recommended that he surrender all his private estates to
the government, and that it assume his liabilities, and pay
him and the members of his family a fixed stipend for their
support. This proposition was accepted by Ismaïl in a
speech which shows that, with all his faults, he has noble
traits of character. As an evidence of his good faith he
conveyed all his estates to the government, and received in
return an annual allowance for the support of himself and
his family. Although Ismaïl was controlled by European
influence his administration of public affairs was to some
extent influenced by native ministers, the principal and
most influential of whom were Nubar, Chérif, Riaz, and
Ismaïl Sadyk, Pashas. Messrs. Rivers Wilson, and De Bligniers,
as representatives of the English and French governments
held portfolios in the ministry, having virtually
control of finances.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1878 the crisis was approaching. All
the debts could not be paid in full, and the commissioners
decided that the sacrifices should be borne equally by all.</p>

<p>On February 18, 1879, a council of ministers was held at
Cairo. As Minister Nubar Pasha and Mr. Rivers Wilson
were leaving in a carriage, they were stopped by a crowd of
army officers, clamoring for payment of arrears of their salaries.
The ministers were grossly insulted, their coachman
wounded, and they pursued to Nubar’s private apartments,
where they were held prisoners until the khedive came with
a regiment of soldiers and dispersed the mob. This affair
created intense excitement in London and Paris, where it
was believed that the attack on Nubar and Mr. Rivers Wilson
was instigated by the khedive as a means to get rid of
Nubar as prime minister, for whom he entertained a profound
aversion. It will be remembered that he was a Christian,
and had the confidence of the European powers, and
was appointed at the dictation of the foreign bondholders.
He immediately resigned and an apology was made to Mr.
Wilson, which he accepted. On the 7th of April, 1879, the
culmination of the crisis was precipitated by the khedive
and the Egyptians themselves. It seemed to be a last struggle
of Egyptians for independence, and was the first real
effort to save Egypt for the Egyptians. Ismaïl dismissed
his ministry, which had been practically forced upon him
by the European powers, and appointed a new one, composed
wholly of Egyptians, with Chérif Pasha as prime
minister. Wilson and De Bligniers were dismissed, but
they refused to surrender their offices and appealed to their
governments. It was a rebellion of Egypt against the western
powers, and the khedive was supported by all the political
and religious influences of the country.</p>

<p>The pashas, the harems, the ulemans, the priests, and the
principal land owners combined to support him in his effort
to regain his lost power. The last straw was laid on the
camel’s back when the new ministry issued a decree on
April 22, 1879, virtually suspending payment of all foreign
debts. This was followed by a demand from the English
and French governments for the abdication of Ismaïl, and
on the 25th of June, 1879, he received an order from the
Porte to abdicate in favor of his son, Mehemet Tewfik,
which he obeyed, and Tewfik was immediately proclaimed
khedive, as Tewfik I. Liberal provision was made for Ismaïl
and his family in a style commensurate with the dignity
of an oriental viceroyalty.</p>

<p>Tewfik formed three successive ministries within four
months, the last on September 21, 1879, in which Osman
Pasha was made Minister of War. On demand of England
Messrs. Baring and De Bligniers were appointed comptrollers-general
of finance with unrestricted authority, and
an order issued that all subjects of the khedive should be
treated alike, the pashas and other officials being required
to pay taxes, and in failure to do so their rents were to be
seized and their produce sold. The condition of Egypt was
now most deplorable. It was at war with Abyssinia and a
most disastrous famine prevailed. It is authoritatively reported
that in September, October, November and December,
1879, 700,000 people in Egypt were in a starving condition,
and that 10,000 actually died from that cause. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
we consider that this state of things was brought about by
forced collections of taxes to pay interest to European bondholders,
and through methods forced upon them for that
purpose, we need not be surprised that antipathy should
arise to European interference, and that some efforts should
be made to relieve this people of those oppressive burdens.</p>

<p>For the purpose of consolidating the public debt, and to
form a plan for its liquidation, a commission was established
of representatives of the English, French, Italian,
Austrian and Egyptian governments. A plan was prepared
by this commission and a law drafted to carry it into effect,
which was adopted by the ministry, and at once put into operation.
It consolidated all debts created before 1880, and provided
for the issuing of bonds for the principal, and coupons
for the interest, and that no suit could be brought on such
debts except as the coupons and bonds should mature, and
for an equitable division and appropriation of the income
so that current expenses should be paid and the surplus applied
to the interest and principal of the debt, and the collection
of taxes was fixed to correspond with the ripening of
the crops. This was the first step toward bringing order
out of chaos. The result surpassed the most sanguine hopes
of the government. The fellahs were able to pay their taxes
out of their crops and have a surplus. Instead of forced collections
the people came voluntarily to the collectors, anxious
and able to pay their taxes. Land rose in the market, and
the future looked prosperous for Egypt.</p>

<p>The very success which attended the efforts of the foreign
commissioners in extricating the country from the quicksands
into which it had fallen—creating confidence and bringing
in capital from abroad, only hastened the time when the
religious national prejudices would be aroused. It was irksome
to them to see all the important public offices in the
hands of foreigners. The better the new system worked, the
more impatient they were to get rid of foreign domination.
Add to this the fact that the salaries paid these foreign officials
were greater than are paid for like services in any civilized
country in the world, and were unheard of in Egypt, and
you can see the real cause of the discontent of the people,
out of which grew the National party. Their motto became
“Egypt for the Egyptians.”</p>

<p>On the 2d of February, 1881, a mutiny broke out in the army.
Osman Reski Pasha, minister of war, had become obnoxious
to the officers of the army, of whom a great number were unemployed.
Osman was accused of promoting Turkish subjects
to positions in the army to the exclusion of natives, and of
treating the latter with contempt. The colonels of the bodyguard
and two other regiments drew up and presented to the
khedive a petition for his removal. It came into the hands
of Osman, who arrested and placed them in confinement in
the citadel. The soldiers of the guard stormed the citadel
and released the colonels, who marched with them to the
palace and demanded an audience of the khedive. He ordered
the insubordinate colonels under arrest, but they refused
to obey him. On consultation with his ministers, he
finally yielded to their demands, and dismissed Osman.
Ahmed Arabi Bey was the leader of this movement, and
the most popular of the three colonels. Some years before
he had been dismissed from his position by Ismaïl without
any good reason, and from that time he determined to devote
himself to the work of securing for army officers a fair trial,
and of protecting the fellaheen from the tyranny and oppression
of government officials. He and his fellow-officers
at that time contemplated a rising in favor of popular rights,
but were deterred by the belief that they would be overpowered.
Arabi was chosen leader, and seven days after
the last occurrence he presented a demand for the dismissal
of the entire ministry, the formation of a constitution and
an increase of the army, and gave notice that the troops
would appear before the palace at four o’clock of that day,
and wait until the demand was complied with. At the hour
appointed, four thousand troops and eighteen pieces of artillery
were drawn up before the palace under the command
of Arabi. The khedive again yielded, formed a new ministry,
and ordered an assembly of notables to be elected by
the people to inaugurate a representative system of government.
The independence and enthusiasm with which the
fellaheen voted for these representatives revealed to the
world the fact that liberal political ideas and the nationalistic
principles of the popular party had taken deep root in
the minds of this ancient race, “which once bore the torch of
civilization, but since has tilled the fertile valley of the Nile
under the whip of many masters.”</p>

<p>The Chamber of Notables resolved that in the new organization
they would control the ministry and the financial
affairs and every other department of the government. This
was a declaration of war on the policy of foreign supervision,
and created consternation among all who were interested in
Egyptian securities. Arabi come to the front as Minister
of War, and was made a pasha. When the session closed
on March 24, 1882, he and his friends were masters of the
situation. His next step was to dispose of the Turkish and
Circassian officers who stood in the way of his plans. They
were charged with conspiracy, tried by a secret court, and
sentenced to confinement for life. At this juncture Admiral
Seymour, with an English fleet, was sent to Alexandria
with the avowed purpose of supporting the khedive. England
and France now demanded that Arabi should be dismissed
from the ministry and sent out of Egypt, as he was
thought to be the principal disturbing element. He however
refused to obey the khedive’s order to that effect, and
became practically the ruler of Egypt. The army was the
willing instrument of his ambition.</p>

<p>The next act in the drama came without warning, and
startled the world by its atrocity. On June 11, 1882, a
bloody riot occurred in Alexandria, in which about three
hundred and eighty Europeans were killed, with a species
of brutality known only to the fanatical followers of Mahomet
in northern Egypt, and discounted the ferocity of the
North American Indians. Arabi was accused of complicity
in it, and the fact that he was in Alexandria, near the scene
of the massacre, at the head of 6,000 troops, and made no effort
to stop the slaughter of women and children which was
going on, renders it probable that the accusation is true.
However, after five hours delay, he took what appeared to
be vigorous measures to stop the slaughter. It was evidently
the outburst of the race hatred of Moslem against Christian,
and Arabs against Europeans. It was the harvest of blood
from the seed sown broadcast by Arabi and the National
party in carrying on their plans to secure Egypt for the
Egyptians. This massacre was followed by the flight from
Egypt of all Europeans and Americans who could get away,
as it was apparent it was the beginning of more serious
trouble.</p>

<p>It was discovered that Arabi, anticipating interference by
England and France, was vigorously building and equipping
fortifications about Alexandria, and threatened the destruction
of all foreigners, and of the Suez Canal, if interference
was attempted. Admiral Seymour ordered him to
cease operations on the fortifications. The work proceeded.
He thereupon demanded the surrender of the forts within
twelve hours or he would open fire.</p>

<p>This bombardment was the first step. The burning of the
finest portions of Alexandria, the horrible murders there,
the concentration of English forces in Egypt against Arabi,
his final defeat and surrender, constitute the story of a war
remarkable principally for the great perturbation it caused
among the powers of Europe, for the small force on the
one side, and on the other for the power, pomp and parade,
and the vast stores of material and men. On the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
of Arabi and his army, for the justness of their cause in the
ostensible purposes of the National party, and on the part of
England for the flimsy pretext of acting under authority of
the khedive, when the only real excuse was the fact that the
Suez Canal is of vital importance for connection with its
East Indian possessions, and control of Egypt is necessary
for the protection of the canal. Especially is it remarkable
in view of the show of force and preparation, for the weakness
of the Egyptian army and the feebleness and unskillfulness
on the part of Arabi and his generals. We can, however,
account for the consternation it created in Europe,
when we consider that Mahommedanism covers a larger
extent of territory and includes more peoples than all the
rest of the world. The religious prejudices of the followers
of the prophet have only tolerated the presence of Christians
when they could be kept under subjection and in servility.
Some point was given to the idea that a religious war was
imminent by the fact that the False Prophet was advancing
into Soudan toward Southern Egypt. What the outcome of
such a war would be was difficult to foresee. It would involve
more than three-fourths of the population of the
world. And while Western civilization would have the advantage
of modern improvements in the art of war, it was
not certain it could compete with the Moslem hordes that
would swarm from Asia and Africa. It would not only
check and greatly set back civilization, but would threaten
to overthrow and destroy it. It is not surprising, then, that
the powers of Europe hesitated. And from the standpoint
of Western civilization England can not be too highly commended
for her energy in crushing out in its inception what
might have ripened into a war involving such tremendous
consequences.</p>

<p>The weakness and unskillfulness exhibited by the leaders
of the National party, and their indifference to the fate of their
subordinates, show that any sentimentality spent upon them
is unmerited, and the collapse of the rebellion upon the first
serious disaster, which, from the Egyptian standpoint, was
a struggle for life and liberty, shows to what state of servility
the descendants of the Pharaohs have been reduced,
and how utterly incapable they are of self-government.</p>

<p>The last act in the drama was performed at Cairo on the
25th of December, 1882. The leaders were nominally turned
over to the government of the khedive for trial and punishment,
charged with the massacre and incendiarism of June
11th, and with rebellion. Nothing awaited them but death
by assassination or public execution. In reality the turning
them over to the khedive was only a form to keep up
the pretext of acting under his authority. In fact the trial
was suppressed because of the complications which would
have arisen from making public the evidences in the hands
of Arabi of the complicity of Turkey in the rebellion.
Under the dictation of England a plea of guilty of rebellion
only was accepted, and sentence of death in form pronounced
upon the seven principal leaders, Arabi, Toulba, Abdelal,
Mahmoud Sami, Ali Fehni, Yacoob Sami, and Mahmoud
Fehni. At the same time a commutation, by the khedive,
was announced to degradation and exile for life, and the
place of exile has been fixed in the English colony of Ceylon.
The ceremony of degradation was performed at Cairo on
Christmas day, and consisted in reading the decree of degradation
to the prisoners in the presence of the army, public
officers, and a crowd of native Egyptians. Immediately
thereafter they were sent to Suez and thence to Ceylon
under guard. A liberal provision is made for their support
in view of the fact that they are state prisoners. About
$10,000 each per year is allowed for their support, so that
life in exile is not altogether an unmitigated hardship.</p>

<p>It is often said in these days that the power of the pulpit
has declined from what it was in the time of our fathers.
The press has stolen a march upon the preacher. The lyceum
draws better than the meeting-house. The stump
speaker has more hearers than the minister. The advocate
for reform makes more stir than the Sunday-going parson.
The newspaper has got to be the American Bible. The
magazine has more readers than the Gospel of Mark, and
the Epistle to the Romans.</p>

<p>But this croaking overlooks the fact that our civilization
is wider and broader than it used to be fifty or one hundred
years ago. It comprehends more interests, strikes the key
to more subjects, sweeps into its ever-widening circumference
a greater variety of pursuits and influences. The pulpit
may be as important as ever and as potent, but relatively
other factors have in these latter days come into play,—art,
science, philosophy, reform, politics, sociology, and thus
have seemingly encroached upon the once almost absolute
domain of religious worship and instruction. But it is
more in seeming than in reality. Because other powerful
auxiliaries have come up alongside of the pulpit to challenge
the attention of mankind, and assist in the great enterprise
of the upbuilding of humanity, it by no means follows that
the peculiar office which the pulpit and the preacher fulfill
may not be more needful and more demanded than ever to
save the souls of men, and bring the kingdom of God on
earth.</p>

<p>It almost however goes without the saying that facts disprove
the dismal theory that our civilization is running
away from the public administration of religion. We have
as mighty preachers in the field to-day on both sides of the
water as ever lifted up their voices in Christendom. I need
only mention Spurgeon, Beecher, Philips Brooks, Moody,
Pere Hyacinth, Bishop Simpson, Prof. Swing, Robert
Collyer. And they draw great audiences, produce great effects,
convert sinners, edify saints, “hurl back the floods of
tyrant wrong” and sin, and bring in the kingdom, as effectually
as was ever done by the Chrysostums and Ambroses,
the Robert Halls and John Wesleys of the past. God hath
not left, and never will leave himself without witness. The
eloquence of the spoken word is not yet dead or buried.
We have placed at the head of our article one of these great
and glorious names, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Baptist
preacher in London. He was born in Helvedon, Essex, near
London, June 9, 1834. He is now therefore in the forty-eighth
year of his age, but how solidly he has packed those
years with services to God and man! His origin was in the
Congregational body of England. He is a self-taught man,
and contrary to what was said of another distinguished self-taught
man, that he had a very poor teacher, Mr. Spurgeon
had a very good and wise teacher. He became a schoolmaster
of others at sixteen, and at eighteen the pastor of a
church at Waterbeach. He soon rose to such popularity
that he was called to London, where ordinary churches
could not contain the crowds that came to hear him. He
occupied successively the Baptist Chapel in Southwark,
Exeter Hall, Surry Music Hall, and now he preaches in a
cathedral-like edifice, called the “Tabernacle,” built for
him, where he has an audience of five or six thousand. But
like Wesley he is not only a great preacher, but a great organizer
and also an affluent writer. On an average he
preaches a sermon every day. Ten or more volumes of his
sermons have been published in England and reprinted in
this country. He has edited the works of some of the old
religious classics. He has published lectures to divinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
students, tracts for the people, as “John Ploughman’s Pictures,”
and “John Ploughman’s Talks with the People.” He
is a Calvinist, but not a close communion Baptist. In popularity
and wide influence among the masses he stands at
the head of the English dissenting pulpit. He has thirty
preaching stations in London. He carries on a divinity
school, and has educated between three and four hundred
young men for the ministry. The expenses of his school
are $25,000 a year which he raises himself. He has, according
to the testimony of his stewards, appropriated no part
of the income of his church to himself for the last three
years. He meets the wants of the great middle class of
English society. His administration drives at the practical,
direct, and pungent application of Christianity to the
sins, crimes, and woes of the great capital of the world, and
in that world of Great Britain he is a mighty power for good.</p>

<p>The secret of his influence is not far or hard to seek. In
the first place, Mr. Spurgeon is built on a large scale in personality
and natural endowment. He is John Bull <i>in
maximo</i>, a stocky frame, big head, vigorous constitution, a
good digester, a deep breather, a massive face, a strong
round-about man every way. It is not native to his constitution
to be sick, and if he is so it is because of the load,
which, like Atlas, he bears on his broad shoulders, of care
and duty and preaching, and divinity school, and writing
and publishing, and travel, and the superintendence of his
thousand and one enterprises to carry forward the cause.
He knows how to work himself, and another secret equally
important, he knows how to make others work.</p>

<p>Some years ago I heard him preach in his throne of
power. It was a sight to behold and never to be forgotten.
Thousands of people gathered to hear one man speak. His
subject was from Corinthians: “We are ambassadors for
Christ.” His tone was kindly, no overbearing, no intellectual
pretense or insolence, such as we sometimes see in
great men, while his appeal was persuasive and rational.
There was a deep and tender tone of sympathy and good
will, an evident desire to bring over to his own happy state
of trust and love those far from God and Christ, wandering
in darkness, in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity.
A deep stream of piety and devotional ardor flowed through
all the services. His language was plain Anglo-Saxon
speech, few “dictionary” words, as they are called, and easy
to be understood by the common people.</p>

<p>But next to his piety and zealous faith, should be given
as instruments of his power, great affluence of illustration.
He tips his sentences not unfrequently with a bit of poetic
fire. He levies on the Bible imagery largely. He uses, as
Jesus did, the common every day’s events and scenes about
him to wing his arrows and point his spears. He has no
subtleties, mysticisms, speculations, to clog the minds of
his hearers. “Jesus and him crucified” is his paramount
theme, as it was that of Paul. He is the John Bunyan of
the nineteenth century, and long may he guide the “Pilgrims”
in their “Progress to the eternal city.”</p>

<p>The same day we heard Spurgeon in the great Tabernacle
we heard Dean Stanley in Westminster Abbey. Both
had great audiences. Both gathered many strangers from
beyond the sea to hear the most distinguished pulpit orators
of Great Britain. Dean Stanley gave his eulogy on the
Bishop of Winchester, who had been instantly killed by a
fall from his horse. It was a memorable occasion, attended
by what was most brilliant in rank, in culture, in power
and wealth in England, the lords and ladies of the empire.
The music transported you to the seventh heaven. The
Dean spoke to the learned, refined and powerful, Spurgeon
to the common people, “not heard of a mile from home.”
The Dean had more learning, culture, taste, and swept a
broader circle of thought; Spurgeon more power, bored
deeper into the heart and conscience. Stanley was more a
literary man and author; Spurgeon a minister and converter
of souls. Stanley is a broad churchman, and aims at the progress
of Christianity in the dialect of the nineteenth century;
Spurgeon lays about him like Talus, with his tremendous
flail, to warn people and drive them from the wrath to
come, and to administer the average orthodox doctrines without
note or comment, or nice speculations. Both are great
men, each good for his sphere. Both refute the notion that
the Christian pulpit of this age can not match that of any
previous age in the power, influence and following of the
noted preachers. There were giants of old, and there are
giants now.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_REGULATE_THE_FASHIONS" id="HOW_TO_REGULATE_THE_FASHIONS">HOW TO REGULATE THE FASHIONS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">From the French of M. AUGUSTIN CHALLAMEL.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>When we speak of past fashions, we must always mention
sumptuary laws at the same time; that is to say, remedial
measures against the excesses of caprice and luxury. As if
wisdom could be decreed by law! We know their unsuccessful
results. But even at the present day, when difference
of rank is no longer marked by difference of dress, we
sometimes meet with persons who are indignant with a
working woman if she ventures to wear a silk gown or a
velvet cape on Sunday.</p>

<p>“No, I can not understand the government not interfering!”
exclaimed a charming “great lady” the other day.
“Only a week ago I was elbowed by a girl with a gown identically
like my own! It is really disgraceful! The rest of
the costume did not harmonize with the gown, and the effect
was wretched; besides, extravagance and equality in dress
are the ruin of scores of working girls. There ought to be a
law against it.”</p>

<p>The laws regulating the quality and cost of dress have
been tried extensively in the past, and had the lady known
the history of past fashions, she would hardly have wished
as she did. Far back in the twelfth century sovereigns began
to issue sumptuary laws in order to restore respect for
the inequality of rank, and to prevent one woman from
wearing garments exclusively reserved for another. Philip
Augustus raised his voice against fur. Philip the Fair issued
prohibitions the wording of which enlightens us considerably
in regard to the manners and customs of those
times. “No citizen may possess a chariot, nor wear grey
fur, nor ermine, nor gold, nor jewels, nor belts, nor pearls.
Dukes, counts, and barons, with six thousand livres a year,
may have four pair of gowns a year, and no more, and their
wives may have as many. No citizen, nor esquire, nor clerk
shall burn wax lights.” Baron’s wives, howsoever great,
could not wear a gown that cost more than twenty-five cents
by the Paris yard; the wives of a lord were restricted to
eighteen cents, and of a citizen to sixteen cents and a half.
These regulations proceeded probably from the following
circumstance: On the occasion of the solemn entrance of the
queen into Bruges in 1301, she saw so many women of the
middle ranks so gorgeously appareled that she exclaimed, “I
thought I was queen, but I see there are hundreds.” Philip
evidently thought it time to restrain the license that allowed
women of any rank to equal his queen.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding legislative prohibitions, the desire of attracting
attention led all women to dress alike. From this
resulted a confusion of ranks absolutely incompatible with
mediæval ideas. Saint Louis forbade that certain women
should wear mantles or gowns with turned-down collars, or
with trains or gold belts. But fashion bid defiance to law. The
great ladies were not yet protected. More than an hundred
years later, in the reign of Francis I., we find the fashion of
wearing three gowns, one over the other, resorted to to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
the distinction in dress. Says a writer of the times:
“For one coat that the wife of a citizen wears, the great lady
puts on three, one over the other; and letting them all be
seen equally, she makes herself known for more than a
bourgeoise.”</p>

<p>Even the quality and color of stuffs have been restricted.
Henry II. allowed no woman, not a princess, to wear a costume
entirely of crimson. The wives of gentlemen might
have one part only of their under dress of that color. Maids
of honor might wear velvet of any color except crimson.
The wealthy classes longed to wear the forbidden material,
but the law only allowed them velvet when made into petticoat
and sleeves. Working-women were forbidden to wear
silk. The complaints became so loud that at last the law-giver
was moved with compassion, and allowed bands of
gold to be worn on the head, gave permission to the working-women
to trim their gowns with borders or linings
of silk, and allowed them to wear sleeves of silk—a whole
dress of such material was denied. These restrictions were
rigorously enforced, and Rousard the poet exclaims:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>It did not hold its station, however. Before the century
was out Charles IX. resumed the war against fashion and
extravagance. He sent out this edict: “We forbid our
subjects, whether men, women, or children, to use on their
clothes, whether silken or not, any bands of embroidery,
stitching, or pipings of silk, gimp, etc., excepting only a border
of velvet or silk of the width of a finger, or at the uttermost
two borderings, chain-stitchings or back stitchings at
the edge of their garments. Nor shall women of any rank
wear gold on their heads, except during the first year of
her marriage,” etc.</p>

<p>Such a king would find much cause for prohibitory edicts
at the present day. And it was not long before kings and
courtiers realized that fashion was the most absolute of all
sovereigns. In 1680 some one laments that “No longer are
our ladies to be distinguished from the women of the people.”
Sumptuary laws never filled the demand, nor are
they the proper weapons by which to overcome extravagance
and folly in dress.</p>

<p>Montaigne writes in 1603 of these attempts to regulate expenses:
“The way seems to be quite contrary to the end
designed. The true way would be to beget in men a contempt
of silks and gold, as vain and frivolous, and useless;
whereas, we augment to them the value, and enhance the
honors of such things, which is a very absurd mode of creating
a disgust. For to enact that none but princes shall
eat turbot, shall wear velvet or gold lace, and to interdict
these things to the people, what is it but to bring them into
greater esteem, and to set every man more agog to eat and
wear them? Let kings leave off these ensigns of grandeur,
they have enough others besides; these excesses are more
excusable in any other than a prince. ’Tis strange how suddenly
and with how much ease custom in these different
things establishes itself and becomes authority. We had
scarce worn cloth a year at court for the mourning of Henry
II., but that silks were already grown into such contempt
that a man so clad was despised. Let kings but take the lead
and begin to leave off this expense, and in a month the
business will be done throughout the kingdom without edict
or ordinance. We shall all follow.”</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HISTORY_AND_PHILOSOPHY" id="THE_HISTORY_AND_PHILOSOPHY">THE HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY
OF EDUCATION.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>VII. ROME.</h3>

<p>In these chapters, as I have before stated, my attempt is
not so much to show what the schools accomplished in the
ancient nations herein discussed, as to show their educative
influence upon the world. Each nation has a mission given
it to perform. Divine Providence gives to each a special
work that is useful to all mankind. The national development
is first an education of itself and secondly an education
of mankind. This is true, in an especial sense, of the
Jews, the Greeks and the Romans. All modern civilization
grows from a three-fold root—Roman law, Greek science
and art, Hebrew spirituality. Of course I restrict the
word “civilization” in the above statement to Christian and
Mohammedan nations—Mohammedan nations have more
Hebrew and Greek and less Roman in their civilization.</p>

<p>We have given some consideration, already, to the Jewish
and Greek educations, and it remains for us here to study
the Roman character and achievements.</p>

<p>Let us place before ourselves the conclusion that thoughtful
writers on the subject have long since reached: The
Roman principle is that of compromise or mutual concession
for the sake of the highest good and the safety of the
state. A more attractive rendering of this principle would
run somewhat as follows: The Roman people learned to
distinguish between individual wishes and desires, and the
duty owed to the state or political whole, and they were the
first to define with great precision the spheres of private
and public rights and duties. Then they conquered the
world and disciplined all peoples into this recognition of
private and public spheres, and destroyed all local patriotism
and all local religions. This destruction of local patriotism
and religion prepared the way for the coming of
Christianity.</p>

<p>According to the general tradition, the origin of Rome
was in the collection of a band of outlaws on one of the
Seven Hills. The historian, Livy, calls them a <i>colluvies</i>, to
express their coming together from different surrounding
nations. Here was the border land of the Sabines, Latins,
and Etruscans. The robbers must stand by each other as
they have a common cause against all surrounding states.
Here in the very beginning we have the most important
element of the Roman principle. We see a union of different
national stocks, different personal habits, different dialects,
different social prejudices, and especially different
religious ideas. All was difference except the common
cause against avenging justice that pursued them. This
however was a cause that involved life and death. They
band together like robbers and make the safety of the community
the chief object, and do not interfere with whatever
private customs and usages the members of the league may
have.</p>

<p>Here we see at the beginning the principle of toleration
of a private or personal sphere for each citizen as contrasted
with the sphere of public duty. The citizen is protected in
the exercise of his own pleasure in his personal affairs
where they are different to the public world, but on the
other hand he must unhesitatingly sacrifice all when Rome’s
interest demands it. His home and religion are matters that
the state does not regulate nor allow neighbors to interfere
with. The public concern of all is the safety of Rome. The
citizen is in constant training to preserve his two-fold attitude
of private and public life. He is always on the watch
to control himself from stepping beyond the prescribed
boundary and trespassing on the province of others, and he
is always jealously defending his own domain from trespass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
He is cultivating a consciousness of legality, a consciousness
of statutes and regulations which are not in conformity
with his own inclination, but necessary for Rome.</p>

<p>Each citizen learns to subordinate his caprice and inclination
to the command of the state. This seems so much a
matter of course with us that we do not at first see anything
strange in the attitude of the Roman citizen. We forget
that we have inherited this from Rome, and that it began
with Rome and had no existence in other nations. With
other people the religious principle and the state were homogeneous.
Where the one penetrated the other penetrated.
The individual lived in harmony with the state because the
political life was all of one piece with the manners, customs,
and habits of private life. The religion extended
over both public and private spheres of life. Hence there
was unity of religion and political duty, without any feeling
of distinction existing between the public and private
spheres of life.</p>

<p>But the Roman life was the beginning of a much deeper
spiritual life. After the individual learns to distinguish
and unite these two phases of his life—the public and private—he
is a much deeper and stronger man, and is capable
of exercising and improving greater personal freedom. He
can realize within himself a far deeper spiritual experience
and attain to a higher and purer idea of God and the divine
life. In fact, after he has been through the Roman national
education, he is fitted for a faith in the divine-human nature
of God.</p>

<p>When the Roman makes treaties with the surrounding
nations he bows to a common will, the will that unites his
own national will with the opposing national will of another
people. A treaty is a sort of higher public will uniting two
national public wills. As opposed to the public will expressed
in the treaty, the public will of either nation is a
relatively private will. Thus the Romans who are famous
for making treaties seem to be occupied with making distinctions
between higher and lower will-powers, and realizing
the difference between public and private wills at
every step and in every degree.</p>

<p>When the treaty is broken, the Roman conceives it necessary
to conquer the nation that breaks its faith and compel
the vanquished people to submit and pass under the yoke
of Roman law. Thus the Roman becomes a conqueror of
the world. There being no higher power that can act as
umpire between Rome and the nations with whom it makes
a treaty, each nation acts as its own judge and is very apt
to accuse the other one of broken faith. An appeal to arms
results in the justification of the strongest. The vanquished
must yield his convictions and submit.</p>

<p>Curtius defines the spirit of the Roman as that of the destruction
of national peculiarities. Rome conquers the
world and educates all nations into the same state of mind
as its own people. The people in Spain and Gaul and Britain,
in Egypt, Asia Minor, Syria, as well as in Greece, all
become like the people of Italy in this respect, and grow to
be very considerate of the boundary line between public
and private life.</p>

<p>Out of this isolation of the private life grows the great respect
for property and ownership which we find in connection
with Roman institutions. The public is not one with
the private, but distinguished from it by the Roman idea.
But the law defines the limits of each and so they do not
conflict.</p>

<p>In private property the citizen finds a sphere wherein he
can realize his personal freedom. By means of property
man satisfies his wants of food, clothing, and shelter. He
is able, by means of property, to gratify a higher spiritual
want of amusement and culture. He may avail himself
of the observation and reflection of his fellow-men and
profit by learning their experience. What our fellow-men
have learned by error and suffering, as well as by observation
and reflection, go to make up the wisdom of the race,
which may be collected, preserved and distributed by means
of the institution of private property.</p>

<p>Property is thus something that connects the particular
individual with the social whole or the human race. In the
sphere of ownership the individual is free and self-determined;
he makes and unmakes at pleasure. With property
he extends the sphere of his private personality and enters
into free alliance with other personalities. By bargain and
sale of chattels he exercises his own private freedom, not by
limiting the freedom of others, but by and through the equal
exercise of freedom on the part of those others. Thus by
the invention of the institution of property the private freedom
of each individual interpenetrates the sphere of the
freedom of others without conflicting with it, but in fact reinforcing
it, so that each man is freer through the freedom
of others. Such is the wonderful significance of this Roman
invention of private right of property.</p>

<p>What we see among other nations in Europe and Asia,
before the Roman law came in vogue, is not the completed
realization of the idea of private property but only the crude
first appearance of it. Property under the Romans is as
different from property in Persia, or even in Sparta, as commerce
is different from piracy. It is the Roman who eliminates
the element of external violence by freeing private
rights from absorption in public rights. Then the freedom
of one individual comes to reinforce that of another instead
of limiting and circumscribing it.</p>

<p>It is one thing to be able to see the universal law in the
particular facts and phenomena. It is quite another thing
to see the universal forms of the will, rules that all individuals
may conform their actions to, and by so doing avoid
all conflict and collision of wills. These general forms of
actions and deeds, when defined in words, become civil
laws. The civil laws define the limits and boundaries
within which each and all individuals may act without
mutual conflict. If these laws are not obeyed one individual
act will neutralize another and both will reduce to zero.</p>

<p>The Roman is able to formulate the general will, and he
compiles the code of laws that descends to modern nations
as one of the three most precious heir-looms. These laws
define the forms in which men may act without contradicting
each other, the forms by which the individual may accumulate
property and realize his personality, and at the
same time help, and not hinder, the personal freedom of all
others. The Roman invented the forms by which a city, a
town, a state may be governed and justice rendered to all,
the forms in which a corporation may exist for the accomplishment
of undertakings too great or too long continued
for the single individual.</p>

<p>Religion in Rome had the two fold character of public
and private. The family had its household gods, its Lares
and Penates. The city had its tutelary deities, under various
forms and names, but all amounting to the same
thing, to wit: the expression of the abstract power of the
state. The state was the highest divinity that the Roman
knew. The gods Jupiter, Quirinus, Janus, etc., all meant
the might of Rome. The deification of abstractions was
carried out to a degree of superstitious whimsicality that
astonishes us. There was conceived a god or goddess for
every process of growth and decay and for every instrumentality
of the natural or of the spiritual, and there was
a divinity that made the bones grow in the child, and a divinity
that assisted the flow of the sewers.</p>

<p>The Roman conception of the divine defined it as some
invisible power that could be made useful to the individual
or the state by some sacrifice or service performed toward
it. The Roman therefore made vows to a particular deity
when he found himself in an emergency. If the deity gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
him success he fulfilled his vow with the greatest punctiliousness,
offering a sacrifice, or founding a temple, or establishing
some worship, in return for the service obtained.
Thus the principle of contract entered the Roman idea of
religion.</p>

<p>Contract is the essential legal basis for the transfer of
property in such a manner as to secure joint freedom of individuals.
Contract in religion as the relation of the individual
to God seems the most terrible of all impiety. But
the Roman in effect made contracts with his gods, showing
the all-powerful hold of the idea of property and legality
over the mind of this nation.</p>

<p>In the family there prevailed a form of ancestor worship
almost as primitive as we found among the Chinese. All
other nations, according to De Coulanges, had ancestor-worship
at one time. It would seem that a more spiritual
faith superseded it in other nations quite early. The special
circumstances of Rome and China encouraged the preservation
of family traditions. In China the entire state government
is patriarchal, and thus wholly conservative of the
principle of the family. In Rome on the other hand the
state separates, as public affair, from the family, as a private
affair, and carefully defines the limits between itself
and the family so as to preserve the latter in the primitive
form. Each family worshiped with stated ceremony the
male ancestors of the family, the oldest son acting as the
priest after the death of his father.</p>

<p>This principle of non-interference with the family customs
and a careful guarding of the sacred privacy of the
family developed a very noble type of woman. The Roman
matrons were sublime examples of heroism, dignity
and purity. The mother had much more influence in the
education of the Roman youth, than in the education of
youth in any other of the ancient nations. On the ninth
day the Roman child was enrolled on the citizen’s register.
But up to his fifteenth year his education was chiefly at
home under the supervision of the mother. He studied
reading, writing, and arithmetic, much the same as the boy
of other nations. But he committed to memory the laws of
the Twelve Tables as carefully as the Hebrew child
learned the Ten Commandments. The Roman child was
educated to be a soldier, to fight for Rome and to be a supporter
of the laws. In his sixteenth year he studied Roman
law with some jurist. One may read in Plutarch, or in
Shakspere’s <i>Coriolanus</i>, how powerful was the influence of
the mother over her son, and how devoted was the mother
to Rome. Roman education prepared the world for Christianity,
by breaking down national idiosyncrasies and
leading up to the idea of the human race—<i>genus humanum</i>.</p>

<p>The system practiced by the Romans after the conquest
of a country was to conscript the young men into the army
and send their legions to a distant frontier. The young men
from Britain might be sent to Spain or Egypt, and those
from Illyria and the Danube, to Britain. In the presence of
a hostile people, speaking a foreign tongue, the raw conscript
found his only safe course to be a faithful adherence to the
Roman eagles. He could not revolt with any hope of success.
In a few years he had become attached to the Roman
cause and cherished it as his second nature; while his relatives
and countrymen afar away had also been obliged to
obey Roman laws until their customs and usages had also
changed to Roman. Thus each conquered nation became a
means in turn of subduing every other nation and converting
them into Romans.</p>

<p>The Persians had conquered nations and held them in
subjection, but they had not attempted to mould the character
and institutions of the conquered people, but had left
them untrammeled, only requiring them to acknowledge
supremacy and pay tribute. After a people recovered independence
from Persia, little evidence remained of Persian
influence. The Roman institutions, on the other hand,
became so firmly rooted among a conquered people that
they remained ever after substantially Roman in character.</p>

<p>The Greeks, we saw, were a cheerful people. They made
games a religious ceremonial, celebrating the physical
beauty of the gods by becoming beautiful themselves.
Beautiful bodies and graceful movements seemed to them
divine. The gods and goddesses fell in love with beautiful
mortals. The Romans on the contrary, were sober and serious,
and would not exercise for the sake of developing
personal beauty, but only to become good soldiers for
Rome. It was shameful in the estimation of the Roman
to expose the naked body. Even within the family the utmost
care was taken to develop and foster the sense of
shame and of decency in the care of the person. The Roman
was a haughty spectator at the games, but would not
himself condescend to appear as a contestant. He bought
slaves or forced his prisoners taken in battle to exhibit
their skill in the arena. He delighted in spectacles where
death-contests of beasts and men took place, because he felt
its symbolic expression of the struggle within his own character,
and his sacrifice of self for the state, and of his arbitrary
will for the general abstract law. The Roman was sober
and thoughtful because his life was occupied in self-restraint.
He perpetually watched himself lest he should go
beyond the limits fixed between the private and the public
spheres of duty.</p>

<p>The result of mingling all nations in the Roman armies
brought about a feeling of brotherhood among the soldiers and
then among the people. There arose conviction that peculiarities
of nation and even of race are accidents that do not
affect the substance of a common humanity. The objects of
affection for the individual—his native land, his country’s
gods, his ties of kindred and friendship, were all ruthlessly
broken by the irresistible might of the Roman empire, and
for these objects of the heart were substituted only the abstract
devotion to the state and devotion to the private
right of property. There resulted a deep heart-hunger for
a spiritual faith that would give to all an object commensurate
with this new idea of the <i>human race</i>. This want
was supplied by Christianity.</p>

<h2><a name="OLD_PAINTINGS" id="OLD_PAINTINGS">OLD PAINTINGS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By ROBERT KEMPT.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />


<p>The oldest picture, known at present, painted in oil colors
on wood, is preserved in the Imperial Gallery at Vienna.
According to Beckmann’s “History of Inventions,” it was
executed in the year 1297 by a painter named Thomas de
Mutuia, or de Muttersdorf, in Bohemia. Two other paintings,
in the same gallery, are of the year 1357; one is by
Nicholas Wursnser, of Strasburg, the other by Thierry of
Prague. It appears, therefore, that painting in oil was
known long before the epoch at which that invention is generally
fixed; and that it is erroneously ascribed to Hubert
Van Eyck and his brother and pupil John Van Eyck, otherwise
called John of Bruges, who lived about the end of the
fourteenth century, and not the beginning of the fifteenth
century, as is commonly supposed. It is pointed out, however,
that there is evidence in the books of the Painters’
Company, under the date of the eleventh year of the reign
of Edward I. (1283), that oil painting was in use at that
time. <i>Vide</i> a communication from Sir Francis Palgrave, in
Carter’s “Ancient Sculpture and Paintings in England.” It
may be added that the art of wood engraving seems to be
older than the invention of printing, to which, perhaps, it
gave rise. The names of the first engravers on wood are,
however, not known. In the <i>Athenæum</i> for 1845, page 965,
is given a fac-simile of a wood engraving bearing date 1418,
which was discovered at Malines in 1844, and is now preserved
in the public library at Brussels.</p>

<p>Old paintings naturally lead to inquiries about old art
schools, one of the most venerable and interesting of which
is to be found in the quaint old Devonshire borough of
Plympton, England. Here the greatest of English painters,
Sir Joshua Reynolds, learnt the first principles of drawing.
Here, too, Northcote, his clever and eccentric pupil, acquired
his education. This was also the first school of Sir
Charles L. Eastlake, P.R.A., and the <i>alma mater</i> of poor
Benjamin Haydon. A few months before his tragic death
Haydon visited the old grammar school, and wrote his name
in pencil on the wall, where it may still be seen:</p>

<div class="center">
“B. R. Haydon,<br />
Historical Painter, London,<br />
Educated here 1801,<br />
Rev. W. Haines (Master)<br />
Head boy then.”<br />
</div>

<p>Nor must it be forgotten that Plympton had the honor of
being represented in Parliament by the greatest of English
architects, Sir Christopher Wren, who was elected in May,
1685, and was the first architect ever returned to the House
of Commons. To return to Reynolds. He was born in the
Master’s house adjoining the school, and some rough
sketches drawn by him in his youth on the walls of the bed-room
in which he first saw the light were to be seen when
Haydon and Wilkie visited the house in 1809, but have since
been obliterated by some barbarous whitewasher. In 1772
Sir Joshua was elected to the aldermanic gown of his native
town, and in the following year he was chosen mayor of the
borough. To show his appreciation of what he deemed a
high honor, Reynolds presented to the town his own portrait,
painted, as it seems, expressly to commemorate his
mayoralty. It was placed in the corporation dining-room,
but the common council had the effrontery to sell the picture
for £150 when Plympton was disfranchised in 1832.</p>

<p>It need hardly be added that Sir Joshua Reynolds’s tomb
(adorned by one of Flaxman’s best works) is almost close to
that of Sir Christopher Wren in the crypt of St. Paul’s, both
in life connected with the little Devonshire town, though
by different ties and at different periods of its history, and
both resting from their labors in the great temple which
Wren built, and which Reynolds sought to adorn with his
matchless pencil.</p>

<p>The subject for this evening, “The Employments of
Heaven,” is in some respects very difficult and, I fear that,
to some of you, the discussion will be less satisfactory. The
science and philosophy of this subject are chiefly by implication
and suggestion. We have, therefore, to depend
almost entirely upon written revelation. I am not unmindful
of the fact that there are not a few people who say:
“Why talk of what the Bible says on this subject? We are
not believers in the Bible, and to us there is no more authority
in it upon this subject than there is in the Odyssey
of Homer, or the Shastas of India.” Yes, I understand you,
but, all the same, let us study the book because of the limited
light we have upon this subject from other sources, and
because it has very much to say respecting this topic, and
because such a man as Sir Walter Scott has said: “There is
but one book—the Bible.” May we not wisely investigate
what the Bible says upon the subject of the hereafter? In
discussing this subject, let us guard against the charge of
mistaken statement concerning things not revealed, and let
us, on the other hand, dwell with a fair degree of fullness
upon those points which, through the teaching of the sacred
scriptures, have been made known to us.</p>

<p>There is one thought that I would like to mention, because
sometimes it is a relief to that skeptical doubt which is
common to the human heart. It is this: That the world in
which we now live, and the fact that we are alive and in
this world, and are conscious, active agents here, are of all
others the chief surprises and the chief wonders. And,
therefore, the fact of the future world, and of our personal
joy and activity in it, should not seem unreasonable. Think
of it! Is any greater wonder possible than that we are! Is
the wonder greater that we are to be conscious after we are
dead, and that we are to be in a place called heaven, than
that we are now conscious and here now in a place called
this world! How came we first in possession of this personal,
wonderful consciousness? This is the thing which is
incredible, if anything is incredible. When a human being
can say, “I now am,” or as some one admirably put it, “I am
here anyhow,” all further wonder ends. To exist at all is a
greater mystery than to exist forever.</p>

<p>In unfolding the subject before us, we begin with the
revelation variously and repeatedly set forth that, in the
future life, there are to be what may not be improperly
termed entertainments, and among them will be royal banquets.
Feasts it is true, though spiritualized, seem contrary
to our ordinary notions of a heavenly life, and seem quite
contrary to other biblical revelation. These things seem to
involve litter, clatter, rubbish. Still we have to confess
that the Bible is quite full and quite clear on this subject.
Note, for instance, the following passages: “For I say unto
you I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine until
I drink it new with you in my father’s kingdom.” Elsewhere
he has said: “And I appoint unto a kingdom, as my
father hath appointed unto me: that ye may eat and drink
at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the
twelve tribes of Israel.” Saith John in Revelation: “He
that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches: To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the
stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving
he that receiveth it.”</p>

<p>We may modify these passages by one other, namely:
“They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more,
neither shall the sun light on them, or any heat.” It is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
therefore, feasting without hunger, and drinking without
thirst. But, says some one, “This is all figurative.” Perhaps
so, we have not said that it is not figurative; but, if
figurative, figurative of what? is a fair question. A figure
implies something represented by the figure. If not, there
is no figure. Without pressing any one for an immediate
answer, we may be allowed to remark that it is not always
what one eats that constitutes a feast, not the appetite only,
but the soul enjoys the richest festal occasion. This introduction
of the kitchen and of kitchen service and utensils
into the kingdom of heaven is repugnant to our best
thought. Between the spiritual and the carnal, we must,
therefore, carefully distinguish. The latest deduction of
both physiology and psychology is that smell and taste are
the senses most employed, especially that of taste; but as
yet there has been made no discovery of what it is that
gives us the sense of smell or taste. It is, certainly, not the
objects themselves. Here is a rose. I don’t smell the rose
but I smell something which comes from that rose through
the atmosphere, called the odor or aroma. Science tells us
that it is an extra organic substance that we smell. Here
is a lump of sugar which I place in my mouth. I do not
taste that sugar, but it is an extra organic substance that I
taste, and not the sugar itself. The most, therefore, that can
be said is not that the rose is sweet, nor that sugar is sweet,
but what we call the aroma of the rose and the flavor of the
sugar are sweet, and of this aroma and flavor science is as
ignorant as a child. Indeed, experiments show that electricity
if delicately applied to certain nerves may variously
produce the various sensations of taste and smell. Now,
take into account this extra organic substance, recognized
in every department of modern science, especially when
the human organism is spiritualized, then you may lift the
spirituality of Heaven as high as you please. You may
make it as immaterial as a dream, still there will be abundant
opportunity to eat and drink at the Lord’s Table in the
kingdom of the Father Infinite and without any kitchen
service required. The kitchen is dispensed with, the table
spread by hands of angels, spread with this extra organic
fruit and food, which are imperishable, which are not literally
eaten, but which none the less awaken every pleasureable
sensation and emotion of the soul. It is, then, that the
spiritual can say to the carnal, “I have meat to eat of which
ye know not of.” It will be the fullness of joy with no
earthly inconvenience, its very privilege, to wait the fulfillment
of Christ’s words. “But I say unto you I will drink
no more the fruit of the vine until the day that I drink it new
with you in the kingdom of God.”</p>

<p>The teaching seems to be, then, that without anything
that is gross, without meat or drinks that are perishable,
without fragments, yet in company with friends and companions,
in company with royal souls, and in company
with the Master, there will be fields of spiritual enjoyment
that resemble in some respects the most royal and festive
occasions of this earth. In other words, royal festival occasions
on earth are typical of the royal festal occasions of the
kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>But there is another kind of employment. It is reasonable,
as well as scriptural, to suppose that investigations
into the various realms of truth will invite our active and
restless minds. One of the most prominent characteristics
of mankind is its unchangeable curiosity. How intensely
interested it is to learn the history of the ruder and early
times! How interested in every scrap of intelligence which
reaches us from the old dead world! How interested, too,
in any light thrown upon the civilization which preceded
ours! What would not a man give for an hour with Socrates
or Plato! What would he not give to have pictured out
vividly before him some incident in the life of Christ! How
entrancing it will be in company with our dearest friends
to explore the secrets of eternity, the secret of God’s purpose,
the divine methods, with ample time, with an all
power of intellect, with the doors of knowledge flying wide
open. We look, we enter, we contemplate, until the soul is
full, and the heart now almost leaps to bathe itself in this
infinite ocean of wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p>Another thought growing out of our general subject, is
that of regal service and employment.</p>

<p>It is often represented in the Bible that redeemed men in
the kingdom of heaven will be a race of kings. Administration
is natural to the best types of humanity. The redeemed,
too, by the discipline of life, will be qualified for
regal affairs.</p>

<p>“He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do
also; and greater works than these shall he do.” “And I
appoint unto you a kingdom as my father has appointed
unto me.” “And I saw thrones and the saints of God sat
upon them, and judgment was given unto them.” “Know
ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the
world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the
smallest matters?”</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, according to biblical theology, that
God is to share chief glories, not with angels nor archangels.
They are only ministering spirits. It is manhood and
nothing else that has the grandest coat of arms worn in
God’s great empire. Just how, just where, we may not understand,
but the fact is clearly revealed that, as the ages
go on, the administration of universal affairs will be committed
to redeemed men.</p>

<p>But, in addition to princely entertainments, search for
truth and royal service, it is clearly revealed that friendly
intercourse and association are to be found in the future
life. Man, the king, will have kingly associates. Said
Socrates, as reported by Plato: “Who would not part with
a great deal to purchase a meeting with Xenophon and
Homer?”</p>

<p>Charles Lamb wonderingly asks: “Shall I enjoy friendships
in heaven, or do all these things go out with my human
life?”</p>

<p>No, we cannot believe upon scientific grounds that it is
possible for these associations to go out. And upon Bible
grounds we are assured that they will be continued and
range through the intermediate ages, and then on through
the eternal ages of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>“Neither marriage nor giving in marriage, but as the angels
of heaven” are words that show that the carnal and the
transitory depart, but the heart is none the less tender
toward the heart which associates with it: “I shall go to
him,” says David, speaking of his dead boy. And Christ
says: “Father I will that they also whom thou has given
me be with me, where I am, that they may behold my
glory which thou hast given me.”</p>

<p>So, I think, we may say with perfect confidence that the
association of old time friends, of mutual rejoicings and
congratulations among old acquaintances, and the pursuit
of truth in the same fields and pathways side by side with
those whom we have known and loved on earth, are as well
assured as any other doctrine in philosophy which has any
bearing upon the future life. Those words of the apostle
that “We are already surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses,”
are a kind of mighty assurance that those whom
we love are already in watching to clasp our hands in their
own.</p>

<p>Once more among the clearly revealed entertainments of
the kingdom of heaven are those of the service of music.
There will be songs and singers in heaven. Indeed, we are
informed definitely as to some of the words which are to be
employed. Three hymns, at least, are named which are to
be sung—“And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of
God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
are thy works Lord God Almighty; just and true are
thy ways thou King of Saints.”</p>

<p>“And they sang a new song, saying: Thou art worthy to
take the book and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast
slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every
kindred and tongue and people and nation.”</p>

<p>Such are the Scripture representations, and are they not
reasonable? Are they not philosophical? Music on earth is
wonderful is it not? “Wonderful!” is your common exclamation
when listening to some extraordinary singer or player.
Yes, music is wonderful; the harmony of sound, the blending
of human voices, the chimes of various instruments, are
all marvelous pieces of human combination and art, and are
thrilling and enchanting when brought near perfection.
When, therefore, in this present life, we find ourselves
thrilled by music if well rendered, can we doubt what are
God’s thoughts respecting it and respecting its use in the
universe, for are we not made in his image? Or when the
giant winds draw their bows up and down the rough mountain
sides, when we hear æolian harps in every tree, and
when we hear the little woodland sparrow with throat no
bigger than a pipe stem, yet with song enough in it to be
heard miles away, when we listen to the many voices
and sounds of nature, can we doubt that God thinks of music
something as we do? And when a passage is faultlessly
rendered by his children can we doubt that he says “well
done?” Is not music too wonderful, too full of charm, too
soothing to the weary, not to have one of the first places on
the platform of our heavenly and eternal entertainment?
Allow me in this connection to call attention to another
fact, namely, that no class of artists is more willing to recognize
the spiritual source of their productions than eminent
musical composers. Before their most successful efforts,
they confess to have heard their own music, and to
have listened, and then given the world what they heard.
Every note was old before it was committed to paper, and
it seemed to those eminent masters that the notes were
heard by the contact of the soul with something invisible.
That is, the “Elijah” of Mendelssohn, the “Creation” of
Haydn, the “Messiah” of Handel, and the like compositions,
came of their own accord, or came as the music comes
from the æolian harps, when touched by the unseen fingers
of the wind. The slave who was asked “Where did your colored
people get those sweet and beautiful melodies?” replied,
“God gave them to us,” and, seemingly, that is the only
way of accounting for those refrains which have melted the
hearts of peasants and of kings. I will not state these matters
dogmatically, but our present relation to the invisible
world may account for some of those inspirations. Therefore,
every good and perfect musical note as well as every
good and perfect gift, cometh down from the Father of Light,
with whom there is no variableness or shadow of turning.
We have divine inspirations and we have divine impressions
oftener, no doubt, than we give credit for. I do not
know but these musical geniuses have God-given intellects
so far reaching, intuitions so acute, that they catch the
notes of the rehearsals of paradise when they are celebrating
the return of some prodigal whom they see here upon
this earth, or the triumphant movements of the Lord Jesus
Christ with his retinue. They have certainly heard eternal
harmony, and harmony is harmony, be it on earth or in paradise,
in time or in eternity. Beethoven, whom some
think the greatest and sweetest of all modern musical
masters, heard the wild melodies and harmonies of the
universe; imitated the hum of insects, the song of birds and
the trickling of water rills, long after being afflicted by an
impenetrable deafness which prevented the slightest sounds
from entering the portals of his ear.</p>

<p>You need not be surprised, therefore, at hearing in the
eternal ages notes with which you are perfectly familiar.
The sweetest and the most inspiring chords that are now
heard are those that will be made there, for the ideal is divine
and the divine is eternal, and the eternal must find
repeated expression. That marvelous production, “The
Messiah” of Handel, which pervades all modern Christian
song, is in some of its parts, we may be very confident, the
same that will chant the Redeemer’s praise forever. “Old
Hundred” and “Coronation” can hardly be dispensed with.
I verily believe that very soon after we enter the portals of
the heavenly world we shall sing “Praise God, from whom
all blessings flow,” and “All hail the power of Jesus’s
name.”</p>

<p>But Revelations still further assures us that the music in
the kingdom of heaven is to have remarkable accompaniments.
There is the mention of harps, and the mention of
trumpets, and the rumble of thunder, all wrought into the
music of that world.</p>

<p>At first thought these revelations are bewildering, but,
perhaps, the peace jubilee of Boston will illustrate what can
be done with ponderous agencies and appliances. The anvil
chorus, as you remember, was extremely popular, where the
music was played on blacksmith’s anvils with solid hammers,
and the artillery accompaniment was even more popular,
where music fell from the blazing lips of cannon. The
child was awe-struck yet delighted, the man of years was
thrilled and said, “Is the kingdom of heaven upon us?” It
is a remarkable fact that gas jets and electricity have been
utilized, and are now made to play the most beautiful arrangements
and harmonies.</p>

<p>Now, such, according to the Bible, are the accompaniments
which are to sustain the redeemed when their hearts
are almost bursting with the song: “Blessing and honor and
glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb forever and ever.” We are repeatedly
assured that the good and pure of the universe from all
lands, east and west, north and south, shall be gathered together,
and that the voice of a great multitude as the voice
of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings
shall be heard pouring forth their melody with the precision,
delicacy and electric touch of a single voice, saying:
“Hallelujah, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.”</p>

<p>Where, of all places on this earth, is music the most enchanting?
You have listened to it in halls and in churches,
you have heard it in city squares and in congregations, and
at the evening hour you have heard it on some beautiful
sheet of water. My question is doubtless answered. Your
ideal is right, for nowhere else is music quite so sweet as by
the water side; and it is remarkable that the inspired writer
tells us that the golden harps are to stand upon the broad
and beautiful, the eternal and delightful sea which extends
before the throne of God, and whose surface resembles sparkling
and transparent crystals.</p>

<p>The metropolis of heaven, in which and before which, as
John tells us, the grand musical entertainments are to be
given, is a beautiful and wonderful city. The measurements
as given in Revelation make it to be a city of fifteen hundred
miles square, a city, therefore, in extent as great as
would be one extending from Boston, Massachusetts, to
Omaha, Nebraska; from Omaha to Monterey, Mexico;
from Monterey to Havana, Cuba, and from Havana back to
Boston—a city larger than all the dead cities of the past,
and of all the living cities of the present combined; and a
city large enough to hold, without any crowding, all the
people who ever lived upon this earth; whose atmosphere
is so telephonic that the slightest touch upon the most delicate
wire of the harp will be perfectly heard in the most distant
palace.</p>

<p>Now, who that has any music in his soul (and who has
not?) but desires that the service of song shall constitute a
part of these heavenly entertainments. After our introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
to that new world, after the reunions, after the formation
of new companionships, when we realize that we
are safe, and when we realize that we are to sin no more, it
seems to me the hearts of God’s children would almost burst,
could they not upon the shores of that crystal sea shout and
sing the triumphs of redemption.</p>

<p>I will just add the thought that all these entertainments,
this kingship, this study, this companionship, this service
of song, are to be endless and without weariness. What
charms and attractions betimes hover about this idea of the
future endless possession and existence! What joy, and,
again, what perplexity! Are we to live on, and on, and on,
as conscious beings, forever, with no thought of death, or of
sickness, or of separation from those we love? This must
be confessed, that, according to revelation, it is a duration
without shore, without measure, without bound, without a
falling leaf, without a setting sun, that is to greet us on the
shores of another world. Speak to us, thou endless existence
filled with songs, filled with entertainments, filled with
friendships, filled with joys,—speak to us, that we may
somehow comprehend thee! And there comes back to us
a solemn response, saying, “O, mortal, you must experience
before you can fully comprehend the magnitude of a future
existence.” But, through his infinite mercy, it will be our
privilege to sing his praise, to feast at the table of royalty,
to enjoy the choicest companionships, to explore the sublime
realms of truth, and to hold the sceptre of dominion forever.
All this belongs to our privilege, and yet we may imperil
our privilege.</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Rev.</span> J. B. THOMAS, D.D.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>There is noticeable similarity between nature and the
Bible, the work and the word. There are countless evidences
indicating that they have the same author. No case
resting on evidence was ever clearer. You can always detect
a master’s style in his creations; certain peculiarities
are sure to appear. You can recognize a Rubens in the old
galleries by the blonde hair, the pinkish tint of the flesh,
and the luxurious stoutness of the physique. So the brush
of Murillo and Guido, and every great artist carries its own
mark. So one mark is on nature and the Bible. They are
done in the same style. In Raphael, the reality of the
earthly, and the gracefulness of the heavenly, never fail to
be blended in wonderful harmony, apparent always to the
practiced eye. His figures are pyramids of strength, transfused
with celestial beauty. Nature confirms some of the
most important doctrines of the Bible—some that men
would rule out, or quietly ignore; but nature comes to their
support, as another attraction of the same God, to the same
truth. In nature, when spring comes, it is by silent and
imperceptible approach, like the dawn of the morning.
First, a bluebird’s note on the bare tree tops (no one saw
her come), then the song of the robin. It is first the crocus,
lifting up her head, and then the tulip and the hyacinth,
while a tint, a shade softer, comes in the sky. One by one
other birds and flowers appear, and at last, the full tide sets
in, and beauty mounts the earth, and balm fills the air.
The glory of the seasons is upon us, and the heart is entranced
with the wonders of loveliness in the midst of
which it moves.</p>

<p>So the Bible: First, the simple promise to Eve, far back
in the moral winter of man’s estate, “The seed of the woman
shall bruise the serpent’s head.” This was the lone
note of the bluebird, sounding out in the midst of the desolations
of a fallen world. It was the first soft tint in the
cold sky. By-and-by the promise to Abraham, “In thy
seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” This
was the trailing arbutus. At last the definite announcement
of a coming Savior to Isaiah, “Behold a virgin shall
conceive and bring forth a son, and his name shall be called
Immanuel [God with us], for he shall save his people from
their sins.” This was the blossom of the fig tree which
showed that summer was nigh. Thus did revelation come
slowly, through ages of delay, till at last in the fulness of
time God unsealed his wonders, the star, the wise men, the
angelic host, the watching shepherds, the “<i>gloria in excelsis</i>,”
the earth breaking forth into singing, the desert
places blooming as the rose, and fragrance of spices in all
the air. Verily the God of nature and of the Bible is one
God, the method of God in nature testifying that it is the
same God in the Bible. In nature everything is in the
concrete. We have the raw material in bulk there: the
gold must be mined and melted; the timber must be cut,
and squared with saw and ax; the stones fashioned with
hammer and chisel; the land cleared and plowed and
dressed. So different is this from the art of man, who puts
everything in rows and squares, and introduces order everywhere.
Similarly, revelation gives ideas, not forms. It
scatters germs of thought, not finished creeds. It throws out
great truths, doctrines, principles, not definite rules and
completed systems. Everything as in nature must be carefully
searched out, reduced and put in order. A casual observer
would have no idea of the riches in the Bible, any
more than in nature. Here is a doctrine mixed with a duty;
there is a precept bound up with a paragraph of history. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
one place is a miracle, where you looked for a promise; in
another is prophecy, where you had expected law, and so on
through. Strange, you say, so many curious things in the
Bible, so much that is irreverent, so little system, so wanting
in arrangement. But it is just like nature. There is a
complete and definite order, a general organic unity runs
from the first page to the last. Written by sixty-six different
authors, and sixteen hundred years in the composition,
it is still one book, one plan. All the parts combine to
make the great whole. It must be studied out. Like nature,
the Bible is planned to tax the higher faculties of man,
to put them to search, and develop and enlarge them by
thoughts and endeavors. Little study makes little men.
What is lightly acquired is carelessly held. Easy lessons
make barren lives. Out of the depths by toil come the great
riches of head and heart. Down from the heights after profound
thought the larger wisdom is brought. It is the
glory of kings to search out a matter, and men become kings
only as God puts them to kingly effort and service. This
method of God in nature makes princes in science, as men
learn to think God’s thoughts after him. This method in the
Bible makes strong men. Verily the God of nature is also
God of the Bible, and they will stand together, the Word as
enduring as the world.</p>

<p>In nature there is no withholding of mysteries, no avoidance
of difficulties, because they may disturb some weak
faith, trouble somebody. The great God of the universe
lets out his power and displays his wisdom, and builds up
to his own level, whether anyone can understand or not. Out
of nothing, nothing comes. Out of the infinite comes infinite
greatness and wisdom, beyond the scope of man.
There is a startling boldness in God’s works. In nature
contradictions are piled mountains high, no matter whether
man can reconcile them or not. Paradoxes abound without
regard to how they will strike men; no explanations
are vouchsafed; men are not followed up and told why this
is, and why that. They have to take it as it comes. In
nature, man is placed in the midst of untold wonders and
marvels, without a word, and he is left there to grapple
with the highest problems, and think them out. God does
not “baby” his children, in these things. This is the highest
kind of teaching. Man never finds his littleness, and
begins to learn, and climb, till he is put on such a stretch.
In this is God’s wisdom, as well as his greatness. Just this
is God’s method, also, in the Bible. It is the most bold and
fearless of books: mysteries utterly inexplicable it sets before
you; difficulties the most irreconcilable it plants on every
page, with no attempt at solution. God is master and in
command; God governs, and not the skeptics or theologians.
Prophecies are uttered, miracles are performed upon God’s
plans, as is easy for him. Man may believe, or let it alone.
As in nature, God can not be less than himself. There is
much in nature and in the Bible that man never can think
out, but nature is not the less to man because it is so much
above him. The very fact helps to lift him; man needs Alps
on Alps above him. If the Bible were more easy, contained
fewer hard sayings and knotty doctrines, it would show a
less wonderful God, it would be a less powerful stimulant
and helper to men. Is not the God of nature and the Bible
one God—the work confirming the book? In nature there
is loveliness and peace, terror and death; what more calm
and delightful than a quiet sunset? What more terrible
than tornado and tempest? You have seen the fire of lightning,
and heard death riding on the blast in the black darkness.
There are peaceful vales of earth filled with the song
of birds, the hum of bees, and the gentle lullaby of brooks.
But are there not cyclones and whirlwinds, lightnings and
thunders, that rend and wreck, and devastate—earthquakes
that swallow up whole cities—volcanoes which belch liquid
fires? In the midst of beauty and loveliness men starve,
and burn, and drown, and rot with loathsome disease, and
die.</p>

<p>Now there is no question in the world’s best thought, but
that God is good, wonderfully good, notwithstanding all
these sufferings and sorrows. Turn to the Bible, what love
is there! what goodness and patience! what mercy and
grace, for every son of man abundantly bestowed! God is
not willing that any should perish. He would rather that
all should turn and live. But suffering for sin is there, and
punishment for guilt. What forked lightnings play against
wickedness! what thunders roll for transgression! There
is the worm that never dies, the fire that is never quenched,
the outer darkness where there is weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth. Heaven is there, with all its bliss, for
those who love and obey God, and hell is there with all its
bale and blight for those who die unforgiven and unreconciled
to God. Because of these things, many throw away
the Bible and reproach God, and seek after an easier way;
but they can not throw away nature, and the same law and
method of government inhere in the very core of nature,
and are stamped in all its structure. Where this truth is
not read out of God’s word, it is still read every day in nature.</p>

<p>In nature there is a majestic order which is gone through,
and then nature has no more to give. There is seed time,
and a harvest. Both have their place and office, and if they
are improved, well, unspeakably well; if disregarded, bad,
unspeakably bad. The Bible offers to man a seed time and a
harvest. The sowing neglected there is nothing to take its
place. This is the only seed time of the soul; swiftly the
summer ends, and the harvest is the end of the world. As
nature treats man, so does the Bible; without faith and
works, the Bible gives nothing; without ploughing and sowing
all the pastures of the prairies would fail to give man
anything; nature cuts off a sluggard with a straw; without
sowing, man reaches the harvest time and brings in no
sheaf. Nature deals squarely: without the seed committed
to her, there are weeds in the autumn; nothing but leaves.
So with the Bible: it demands our confidence, and asks
our service; we must heed its call. Nature is so made as
to reward man increasingly, as he rises in intelligence and
his wants multiply. When wood was gone for fuel, coal
came. When the whale oil gave out, petroleum was at
hand. After the paddle came the sail, then the steamship.
When the mail carrier was too slow, the rail car appeared,
followed by the lightning of the telegraph. Nature has her
supplies in waiting, and reveals them more and more
through the growing needs of the ages. So of the Bible.
Many said the Bible would do for the stiff-necked Jews in
Palestine, but it would never suit the practical sense of the
Romans and the subtle intellectual taste of the Greeks. It
did both. Then it was claimed it would not avail for the
barbarians of northern Europe. It was adopted by every
European nation. Still it was held that the Bible would
not reclaim cannibals and the savages of Africa. It has
done for all, lifted all of every class which it has touched,
and it has power to carry the race higher and wider till the
end of time.</p>

<p>An oriental prince brought a tent to his father in a
walnut shell, so runs the legend. The king took it out and
began to unfold it. It covered the king and his counselors.
It covered the royal household. It covered his generals and
the army. It covered the kingdom. It covered the whole
world. It was Christianity. God was the father, and the
prince was Jesus Christ, the Messiah. The kingdoms of
this world shall become the kingdom of our Lord. The
God of nature and of the Bible is one God.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_RICHARD_GREEN" id="JOHN_RICHARD_GREEN">JOHN RICHARD GREEN.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Rev.</span> H. A. HAWEIS, M.A.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Before the publication of Mr. Green’s “Short History,”
86,000 copies of which have been sold in England alone, Mr.
Green, although a voluminous essayist in the <i>Saturday
Review</i>, was absolutely unknown by name to the general
public. It is not true, as was asserted in a leading journal,
that the success of his book surprised his friends. In 1863,
the clergyman whom he followed at Holy Trinity, Hoxton,
said to me, “I think we have a giant among us in Johnny
Green.” “I made up my mind about that,” I replied, “the
very first night I saw and spoke to him.” Mr. Freeman,
Prof. Stubbs, Dr. Stanley, and, I may say, Archbishop Tait,
all knew of his powers before he became famous at a leap,
and I venture to say not one of them was surprised at his
success. I think he was more surprised himself.</p>

<p>He was filled with a great love of historical study, but
was generally diffident about his own work. “I read it
over,” he said to me in the old days, when I was favored
with copious extracts; “and I write and re-write, and wonder
after all whether it is worth much—whether any one
else will read it!”</p>

<p>His own standard was so high, his knowledge so great,
and his critical friends, Freeman, Stubbs, Brewer, etc., so
accomplished, that he was inclined to be generally very
modest about his own rank as an historian, and at times
even wavered in his general design.</p>

<p>When I first knew Mr. Green, he was revolving a work
which should deal, I believe, with the Plantagenet period,
illustrate the story of the Great Charter, and the making of
the English political constitution. The first fragment he
put into my hand in type was Stephen’s Ride to London.</p>

<p>At the instance of Mr. Macmillan, the publisher, he
abandoned the <i>magnum opus</i> for a season, and taking, in
one wide sweep, the whole of English history, produced
that unique and popular narrative which raised him immediately
into the very first rank of historians.</p>

<p>I remember his anxiety to bring the book within the
reach of the masses, to make it a cheap book, his battle
with the publisher on that ground, and his final victory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They will not see,” he said, “that by this horror of <i>dead stock</i> and
constant issue of dear books, which means small profits and quick
returns to them, they miss the bulk of the middle classes, who are
the real readers—the upper classes and the very poor don’t read—and
you make your new books so dear, that your middle class, who
do, can’t buy. Look at America; you ought to bring literature to
people’s doors. If I were a publisher, I would have a vast hawking-system,
and send round my travelers with cheap books to every alley
and suburban district within ten miles of London.”</p></div>

<p>This intense sympathy with the people, no doubt, had to
do with those innate democratic and republican tendencies
in Mr. Green which so alarmed the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, but
they were immensely quickened by his many-sided experiences
in the East-end of London.</p>

<p>In those Hoxton and Stepney districts, where he was my
fellow curate, and my constant friend and companion for
two years, he was learning to know the English people. He
had read about them in books. In Stepney he rubbed elbows
with them. He had a student’s acquaintance with
popular movements; but the people are their own best interpreter;
and if you want to understand their ways in the
past, you can not do better than study our present poor-law
guardian, navvy, artisan, East-end weaver, parish Bumble,
clerk, publican, and city tradesmen, in the nineteenth-century
flesh.</p>

<p>Mr. Green never worked more vigorously at his history
than when he was busy reading its turbulent popular movements,
and mixed social influences, secular and religious,
in the light of mechanics’ institutes, poor-law difficulties,
parochial squabbles, and dissenting jealousies. The postponement
of his history until the harvest of this precious
experience had been fully reaped, gave him that insight
into the secret springs of popular enthusiasm, suffering, and
achievement which makes his history alive with the heart-beats
of our common humanity, instead of mouldy with the
smell of moth-eaten MSS. and dead men’s bones.</p>

<p>That slight nervous figure, below the medium height;
that tall forehead, with the head prematurely bald; the
quick but small eyes, rather close together; the thin mouth,
with lips seldom at rest, but often closed tightly as though
the teeth were clenched with an odd kind of latent energy
beneath them; the slight, almost feminine hands; the little
stoop; the quick, alert step; the flashing exuberance of spirits;
the sunny smile; the torrent of quick invective, scorn,
or badinage, exchanged in a moment for a burst of sympathy
or a delightful and prolonged flow of narrative—all
this comes back to me, vividly! And what narrative, what
anecdote, what glancing wit! What a talker! A man who
shrank from society, and yet was so fitted to adorn and instruct
every company he approached, from a parochial assembly
to a statesman’s reception!</p>

<p>But how enchanting were my walks with him in the Victoria
Park, that one outlet of Stepney and Bethnal Green!
I never in my life so lost count of time with any one before
or since.</p>

<p>Green would live through a period. Two hours on the
Venetian Republic, with every conceivable branch of allied
history, literature, and politics thrown in, yet willing to listen
and gather up at any moment; infinite speculations at
other times on theology, philosophy; schemes for the regeneration
of mankind; minute plans for the management
of our East-end districts; anecdotes of the poor; rarer veins
of sentiment and personal criticism.</p>

<p>I have sometimes, after spending the evening with him
at my lodgings, walked back to St. Philip’s Parsonage,
Stepney, toward midnight, talking; then he has walked
back with me in the summer night, talking; and when the
dawn broke it has found us belated somewhere in the lonely
Mile-end Road, still unexhausted, and still talking.</p>

<p>At such times we have neither of us undressed all night—that
was so especially in the cholera times—but I would go
back to St. Philip’s and sleep on a sofa till breakfast-time.</p>

<p>In those days we were both feeling our way, through similar
experiences, to conclusions of a somewhat different nature;
but the memory of many precious hours of soul-communion
remains with me, as something sacred and beautiful
beyond words. I think at such times we grow in mind
and develop in character in days and nights, more than in
months and years of slower vitality and lessened intensity.</p>

<p>In 1866 the cholera broke out in the East-end of London.
Mr. Green was then Incumbent of St. Philip’s, Stepney, and
I had just removed to a curacy at the West-end; but his position
at this time was very lonely, and I was glad to go out
to be with him whenever I could. I am sorry to say that
in the general cholera panic a good many who ought to have
remained at their posts forsook them, and this made the
work very heavy for people of any means and influence who
still felt bound to reside in the affected districts.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Green’s parish did not suffer as heavily as
some, yet in some streets the mortality was very great. The
dead could hardly be got away quickly enough. The neighbors
often refused to touch them. I have known Mr. Green
take an active part in sending off the cholera beds for burning,
and getting the corpses out of the houses. The only people
who seemed willing to help him were the lowest women of
the town. These poor girls rallied round the active and
public-spirited clergyman; and it was no uncommon thing
to see Mr. Green going down the lowest back streets in
Stepney, on his way to some infected house, between two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
women of the town, who had volunteered with him on such
sad and perilous service to the dead and dying, as was daily
to be done, and was daily being left undone, in those dismal
times.—<i>The Contemporary Review.</i></p>

<h2><a name="A_TROPICAL_RIVER_IN_FLORIDA" id="A_TROPICAL_RIVER_IN_FLORIDA">A TROPICAL RIVER IN FLORIDA.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By S. J. M. EATON, D.D.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>This State reaches down toward the tropics. The twenty-ninth
parallel of latitude marks the frost line. Below this is
the land of perennial flowers and ever ripening fruits.
Even before you reach the favored line there are scenes and
surroundings that remind you that the winter is past, that
the time of the singing of birds is perpetual, and that nature
is most prodigal of her gifts in lands nearest the pathway of
the sun. In recalling the history of Ponce de Leon, one
can not fail of sympathizing with him in his search for the
fountain of perpetual youth. That search was not only
characteristic of the age in which he lived, but in sympathy
with the secret wants and wishes of all the lands and all the
ages. Moreover in such a quest as this, Florida of all
places seems fittest and best. It was rightly named at the
first “The land of flowers.” They bloom in wondrous fragrance
on the orange and lemon trees; they expand in gigantic
proportions on the banana tree; they break forth
in lavish magnificence on the magnolia. And along the
rivers and other water courses strange trees and gorgeous
shrubs greet the eye, and tell how prodigal nature is in the
display of her resources, and with what wonderful magnificence
she can clothe the face of the landscape in regions remote
from wintry blasts. Even in central Florida, where
frosts sometimes come, there is a wealth of trees and flowers
and fruits that transforms the whole country into fairy land
almost, as the summer sun with its genial heats kisses it into
life, beauty, and fragrance.</p>

<p>The Ocklawaha River is one of the delightful features of
central Florida. It is wild and weird and novel in all its
aspects. One of its branches is the Silver Spring, that is
really an anomaly in nature. This branch of the river has
its origin in the celebrated fountain known as the “Silver
Spring,” and that as a fountain might, from its beauty and
purity and liquid clearness, well be mistaken for the fabled
one that was the object of the quest of Ponce de Leon.
Whether it was ever visited by this romantic knight or not,
it is worthy to be the shrine of many a pilgrim in search of
the beautiful and the romantic. This wonderful spring
gushes forth from the bosom of the earth in volume sufficient
to form at once a small river. The steamboats run up
and float in the bosom of the spring, which is large enough to
float four or five at once without jostling. The water is
clear and sparkling, and although seventy-five feet in depth,
yet as you gaze down into its recesses every pebble and
shell can be seen as plainly as though in the bottom of a
small vase. And as the boat rests upon its bosom noiselessly
and quietly, you think of the simile of the swan,
“floating double—swan and shadow.” This immense volume
of water comes up noiselessly, causing scarcely a ripple
upon the face of the spring, and floats away as silently amid
the shadows, to join the main body of the Ocklawaha.
Whence comes this immense reservoir of water? Where
is the hidden source that furnishes its mighty volume?
Were it not for its crystal purity and sweetness we might
imagine it held mysterious communion with the ocean, and
drew its vast supply from the bosom of the great deep. The
outflow maintains its purity until it joins the main branch
of the river, when its association with it causes it to partake
of the same character, becoming somewhat muddy, and
bearing the dark shadows of the overhanging trees, and
thickly strewn with the leaves of aquatic plants that grow
luxuriantly along its margin. From the Silver Spring down
into the Ocklawaha, and on to its junction with the St. John’s,
the channel is narrow and tortuous, running toward every
point of the compass, spreading itself out to great widths
in some places, in others confined within its narrow channel,
but always surrounded with wild and strange scenery.
Although in the general the banks are utterly indefinable,
as the water runs back to an indefinite distance, yet there
is no appearance of aught that would cause malaria. Every
here and there a slight avenue opens through which a skiff
or canoe might be pushed far out into the forest. The channel
itself is so narrow and tortuous that the steamer threads
its way with great difficulty. In many places the branches
overreach the stream and seem to bar the further progress
of the little craft, and render futile all efforts to proceed.
In some of the narrow turns a stout boatman is stationed in
the bow with a pole to assist in turning the boat when almost
a right angle prevents the ordinary working of the machinery
in its navigation.</p>

<p>All along this wonderful stream nature reveals her most
luxuriant growth of vegetation. Here is the palm, with its
strangely contorted trunk and corrugated bark. By its
side is the palmetto with fantastic branches, and wide-spreading
leaves. Many of the trees send up their gnarled
roots in high arches underneath which the water runs at
will. Great trailing masses of vines cling to the trees, and
weigh down their branches almost to the water, often
reaching from one tree to another, making a dense grove,
and shutting out the sunlight from the water beneath.
Lower down, and clinging to the banks on either side, are
all manner of aquatic plants, beautiful in leaf and luxuriant
in flower, gleaming often like bright jewels in the soft sunshine.
Lilies of various varieties rest in the water, their
bright green leaves surrounding their flowers of waxy white
and yellow gold as they recline in their cool bath. By their
side are plants with arrow-shaped leaves, with white
blooms lined with pistils and stamens yellow as virgin gold,
and others with flowers of blue, around which gorgeous little
humming birds, reflecting the sunlight, and flashing like
living jewels, buzz and coquet with the flowers as they extract
their luscious sweets for a moment, and then dart off
with a flash and disappear. Animated nature is busy adding
variety to the scene, from beauty all the way to the
beast. Golden beetles, blue-bottle flies, and gilded butterflies
in velvet and spangles, float to and fro; water-bugs with
varnished wings dart over the surface of the water. Birds
of gorgeous plumage arise in the distance and sail up the
stream. The oriole with its magnificent feathers of orange
and black; the blue jay with its livery of blue and white,
and its sharp cutting note, and the great red flamingo, with
awkward, ungainly form, its long spindling legs and small
snake-like neck, and plumage of red, like an Egyptian sunset,
are seen; the former two darting quickly from tree to
tree; the latter standing in the water in some sequestered
spot, idly dreaming the time away, and apparently indifferent
as to whether the earth turns upon its axis or not.
Near the bank a water serpent might be seen urging his
way with arrowy motion through the water, defiantly thrusting
out his tongue with a malice born in Eden, perhaps, or
lying in the warm sun on a fragment of bark, not considering
it important to move, yet pushing out the same scornful
challenge. At times a magnificent specimen of the alligator
is seen in the distance sunning himself on a log, but
rolling incontinently into the water at the approach of the
boat, or the slightest alarm from any cause. The poor
saurian who has arrived at years of discretion, has learned
from bitter experience that the human sportsman carrying
firearms is not to be trusted, in this age of Spencer rifles. He
therefore retires in good order at their approach. But nearer
at hand the infant alligator has less fear. He can be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
creeping up the bank, careening upon the waves that are
thrown up by the motion of the boat, sporting in the shallow
water with youthful indifference to danger, and with
great stupid eyes and shockingly open countenance, gazing
up at the passing visitors. And so the boat glides and twists
and forces its way down the current, the branches on either
side sweeping its sides and even its upper decks. The entire
scene is one of kaleidoscopic beauty and variety, until
the mighty St. John’s is reached, and the craft that has done
you such good service is safely moored at the wharf at Palatka.</p>

DRINK.</a></h2>

<p>Coffee is the berry of an evergreen tree, which grows to a
height of about twenty feet, and which is largely cultivated
in Arabia, Ceylon, Jamaica, and the Brazils. The berry is
plucked when sufficiently ripe, and carefully stored away.
It is principally composed of a sort of hard paste or meal,
similar to that of the almond or bean, which is destined by
nature to form the earliest nourishment of the young germ
contained in the seed. When this meal is exposed to strong
heat, it is partly turned into the fragrant flavor, which is
familiar to all drinkers of coffee. Hence coffee is always
roasted before it is employed in the preparation of beverage.
The process is best accomplished by placing the berries in
a hollow cylinder of iron, kept turning rapidly round over
a clear fire until they put on a light chestnut color, when
they require to be cooled quickly by tossing them up into
the air. Roasted coffee contains, besides its fragrance, the
white nerve food already alluded to in speaking of tea, a
remnant of the nutritious meal, unaltered by the roasting,
and a slightly astringent matter. Its nature is, therefore,
singularly like to that of tea, and its action on the living
frame is precisely the same. When drunk in moderation,
coffee supports and refreshes the body, and makes the food
consumed with it go further than it otherwise would. Coffee
is, upon the whole, less astringent than tea; it also contains
only half the quantity that tea has, weight for weight,
of the active nerve food. Hence it can be taken stronger
than tea, and so has more of the other nourishing ingredients
in any given bulk. A cup of strong coffee generally
holds about the same quantity of the active nerve food as a
weak cup of tea.</p>

<p>As with tea, so with coffee; it requires to be prepared differently,
accordingly as the object is, to get from it the finest flavor
or the greatest amount of nourishment. The most delicious
coffee may be made by using a tin vessel, called a percolator,
having a false bottom at mid-height, drilled full of fine
holes, and a spout coming off from beneath the false bottom.
Finely-ground coffee is to be pressed and beaten down
firmly upon the false bottom, and then boiling water is to
be poured over it through a kind of coarse cullender, so arranged
as to break its descent into a boiling shower. The
hot water thus gently rained down on the coffee then drains
gradually through it, carrying all the finer parts and flavors
with it into the vessel beneath, but leaving behind the
coarser matters. For the convenience of consumers, coffee
is now commonly removed from the roaster at once into a
mill driven by steam, and is there ground while still hot.
It is then pressed out from the mill directly into tin cases
prepared to receive it, these being immediately closed
very carefully. By these means the coffee is sent out, ready
for use, with all its most excellent qualities clinging about
it. Three drachms of ground coffee of this quality are
abundantly sufficient to furnish two small cups of a most
delicious beverage.</p>

<p>When quantity of nourishment, rather than fineness of
flavor, is the thing desired, the ground coffee should be
placed in a clean dry pot standing over the fire, and be kept
there until thoroughly hot, being stirred constantly, so that
it may not burn. About five grains of carbonate of soda
should then be added for each ounce of coffee, and boiling
water be poured on, the whole being closely covered up and
allowed to stand near the fire, without simmering, for some
time. When about to be used, it should either be gently
poured off into cups, without shaking it, or it should be
strained through a linen cloth into another pot. An ounce
of coffee employed in this way is sufficient for the preparation
of two pints of strong nutritious drink.</p>

<p>A small evergreen tree grows in the West Indies, Mexico,
and Peru, which bears a large fruit something like a melon.
In this fruit there are a great number of seeds resembling
beans. When the fruit is ripe, it is plucked from the tree
and split open, and the seeds are picked out and dried in
the sun. After these beans have been roasted in an iron
cylinder, in the same manner as coffee, they, too, become
bitter and fragrant, and are turned into what is known as
cocoa. To form cocoa nibs, the husk of the roasted bean is
stripped off, and the rest is broken up into coarse fragments.
In the preparation of chocolate, the cocoa nibs are ground
up and turned into a sort of paste, by admixture with sugar
and spices. The unhusked bean is also crushed between
heavy rollers, and made into a coarser kind of paste, with
starch and sugar, and is then sold in cakes.</p>

<p>Cocoa contains about the same quantity of the nerve-food
ingredient as tea, and besides this it also contains a nutritious
meal. More than half its weight is, however, made
up of a rich oily substance, nearly resembling butter in nature.
When cocoa is prepared by stirring the paste up in
boiling water, all these several ingredients are present in
the drink. It is then as nourishing as the very strongest
kind of vegetable food, and scarcely inferior to milk itself.
It indeed is richer than milk in one particular; it contains
twice as much fuel substance, or butter, and if the nerve-food
ingredient be taken into the reckoning, it is scarcely
inferior in supporting power. On account of its richness it
often disagrees with persons of weak digestion, unless it be
prepared in a lighter way, that is, by simply boiling the
cocoa nibs in water, and mixing the beverage produced
with enough milk to reduce its great excess of oily principle.
Cocoa serves at once as an agreeable and refreshing
beverage, and as a highly nutritious food for healthy and
hard-working people. It has in itself the excellence of milk
and tea combined.</p>

<p>The beverages which are also prepared by soaking the
seeds of vegetables in hot water, but which are not then
drunk until a further change of the nature of partial decay
has been produced in them, are of a very unlike character
to those which have been hitherto under consideration.
Although there are several different kinds of this class, they
all stand together under the family name of beer. Now
this much must at once be said for these beverages. There
is in all of them both flesh-making substance and fuel-substance.
The first gives to the liquor its body, and the second
confers its sweetness. The barley-corn contains the
same kinds of ingredients as the wheat-grain, and by the
operation of malting the starch is chiefly turned into sugar.
If a gallon of strong ale be boiled over a fire, until all the
more watery parts are steamed away, there will be found at
the bottom of the vessel rather more than a quarter of a
pound of dry remainder. This is flesh-making substance,
and sugar, which were originally taken out of the malt. If
a gallon of milk were treated in the same way, there would
be found nearly a pound of similar dry substance. Strong
beer therefore contains about one-third part as much nourishment
as an equal quantity of milk. When beer is drunk,
its watery parts are at once sucked from the digesting-bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
into the supply-pipes, to be poured through the body with
the blood; this is how beer quenches the thirst. The thicker
portions are pushed on through the sluice-gate of the stomach
in a digesting state, and are, in fact, treated in every
respect as ordinary food.</p>

<p>Mixed with the thinner parts of beer, which are thus
sucked into the supply-pipes, there is, however, an ingredient
which is not as unquestionably nourishing as the
thicker principles, and which certainly is not as good a
thirst-quencher and dissolver as water. Flesh-making substance
and fuel-substance, either in the state of starch or sugar,
may be kept unchanged any long period of time if thoroughly
dry, and shut up from the air. When they are moist
and exposed to the air, they directly begin to spoil and decay.
In beer, these substances are mixed with a large quantity
of water, and are exposed to the air, at least during the
brewing. Hence, in beer, both are found in a spoiled and
decaying state. In this case, the process of decay is called
fermentation, or “puffing up,” because the vapors produced
by the decay, froth the sticky liquid in which they are set
free. The yeast which rises to the surface of fermenting
beer, is decaying and spoiling flesh-making substance. The
spoiled fuel-substance (sugar) froths and bubbles away into
the air as vapor.</p>

<p>But the fuel-substance (sugar) does not, as it decays, bubble
away into vapor all at one leap. It makes a halt for a little
while in a half decayed state, and in this half decayed state
it has a very spiteful and fiery nature. In that fiery and
half-decayed condition it forms what is known as ardent, or
burning spirit. Beer always has some, as yet, undecayed
and unchanged sugar remaining in it, when it is drunk, but
it also always has some half decayed sugar or spirit, and
bubbling vapors formed by the progress of decay. It is
these ingredients of the beer which give it the fresh and
warm qualities for which, as a beverage, it is chiefly esteemed.</p>

<p>The spirituous ingredient of fermented liquors is directly
sucked with the water out of the stomach into the supply-pipes
of the body, and poured everywhere through them.
There is no doubt concerning that fact. Animals have been
killed and examined a few minutes after fermented liquor
had been placed in their digesting bags, and the ardent
spirit has been found in great quantity in their supply-pipes,
their hearts, and their nerve-marrows and brains.</p>

<p>But some doubt does yet remain as to what the exact nature
of the influence is which the ardent spirit exerts, when
it has been introduced into these inner recesses of the living
body in small quantity, and as much diluted by admixture
with water as it is in most beers. Some persons, whose
opinions can not be held to be without weight, believe that
diluted spirit is capable of aiding the nourishment of the
body—of acting as a sort of food. Others of equal authority
are convinced that it can do nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>But however the matter may appear regarding the power
of ardent spirit to nourish, no doubt can be entertained of
the fact, that it certainly is not a necessary food. There
is actually nothing of a material kind in the bodies of human
creatures, which is not also present in the frames of the
irrational animals. The same kind of structures have to be
nourished, and the same kind of bodily powers to be supported
in oxen and sheep as in men. But oxen and sheep
fatten, and grow strong, and are maintained in health without
ever touching so much as a single drop of ardent spirit.
There are hundreds of men, too, who preserve their vigor and
health up to great ages, without even tasting fermented
liquors.</p>

<p>It must also be admitted that there are great numbers of
people who use fermented liquors in moderation every day,
of whom the same can be said. But it is to be feared that
those who are safely moderate in their employment of these
treacherous agents, are a really small band compared with
those who allow themselves to be continually within the
reach of unquestionable danger. In the United Kingdoms
of Great Britain and Ireland, with a population amounting
to rather less than thirty millions of individuals, when the
numbers were lately reckoned, there were yearly sixty-one
millions of gallons of ardent spirit consumed as beer; thirty
millions of gallons as spirits; and nearly two millions of
gallons as wine.</p>

<p>There is, yet again, another very important point of view
from which the habitual moderate use of fermented liquors
must be contemplated. A pint of strong beer is in itself no
very great thing. Many people swallow it almost at a single
draught, and in less than a minute. The trifling act, however,
entails one serious consequence when it is performed
day by day. A pint of strong beer cannot be bought at a
less cost than threepence. Threepence a day, at the end of
a year, amounts to £4 11s. 3d. If it be only laid by and
made no use of, at the end of sixty years, it amounts, under
the same circumstances, to £273. If employed, instead of
being laid by, it might be improved at the end of sixty years
into a large fortune. Hundreds of men have made thousands
of pounds with smaller means.</p>

<p>Money, of course, is of no great value in itself; it is only
of value when applied to good service. But herein lies the
gist of the matter. Money always can be made good use of.
If a young man at the age of eighteen begin to lay by threepence
every day, instead of buying a pint of beer with it,
and continue to do the same thing for two years, he may
purchase with the saving an allowance of £10 a year, to
commence at the age of sixty-five years, and to be continued
as long as he may thereafter happen to live. If he laid
by threepence a day for five years, he could purchase with
his savings, at the end of that time, an allowance of ten
shillings a week, to commence at the age of sixty-five years.
If a young man at eighteen begin to lay by threepence a
day, and continue to do the same thing from year to year,
he may at once purchase the certainty of being able to leave
behind him a little fortune of £300 for his wife or children,
or any other relatives who may be dear to and dependent
upon him, whenever death puts an end to his earthly labors!
Surely no rational and prudent man would ever think even
22,000 pints of profitless beer an equivalent for such a result
of his industrious labor. It is by no means too strong an
expression to speak of the beer as profitless, for this reason:
A gallon of strong beer contains a quarter of a pound of
nourishment, bought at the cost of a couple of shillings.
Two shillings would purchase more than three pounds of
meat and bread! The direct money value of ardent spirits,
swallowed every year by the inhabitants of the British isles,
exceeds ninety millions of pounds sterling.</p>

<p>Although there may be question and doubt as to the character
of the influence this fiery substance exerts, when
poured out to the living human frame through the supply
pipes, in moderate quantity, and weakened by mixture with
a large proportion of water, all question and doubt disappear
when its action in greater strength and in larger quantity
comes to be considered. An inquiring physician, Dr. Percy,
once poured strong ardent spirit into the stomachs of some
dogs, to see what would happen to them. The poor animals
fell down insensible upon the ground directly, and
within a few minutes their breathing had ceased, their
hearts had stopped beating, and they were dead. Some of
the dogs were opened immediately, and it was then found
that their stomachs were quite empty. All the ardent spirit
had been sucked out of them in a few short minutes. But
where was it gone to? It was gone into the blood, and heart,
and brain, and there it was discovered in abundance. It
had destroyed life by its deadly power over those delicate
inner parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p>Human beings are instantly killed when they swallow
large quantities of strong ardent spirit, exactly in the same
way as Dr. Percy’s dogs. A few years ago two French soldiers
made a bet as to who could drink the largest quantity
of brandy. Each of them swallowed seven pints in a few
minutes. Both dropped down insensible on the ground;
one was dead before he could be picked up, the other died
while they were carrying him to the hospital. A man in
London soon after this undertook to drink a quart of gin,
also for a wager. He won his bet, but never had an opportunity
to receive his winnings. He fell down insensible,
and was carried to the hospital, and was a dead body when
he was taken in.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, therefore, what strong ardent
spirit, in large quantities, does for the living body. It kills
in a moment, as by a stroke. It is a virulent poison, as
deadly as prussic acid, and more deadly than arsenic. Even
when it is not taken in sufficient abundance to destroy in
the most sudden way, it often leads to a slower death.
Striking illustrations of this truth are presented continually
in every corner of even this civilized land. It has been
fully ascertained that not less than one thousand persons
die from the direct influence of ardent spirit, in the British
isles, every year.</p>

<p>When people do not die directly upon swallowing large
quantities of ardent spirit, it is because they take it so gradually
that nature has the opportunity of washing the greater
portion of it away through the waste-pipes, before any
sufficient amount of it has gathered in delicate internal
parts for the actual destruction of life. Nature has such a
thorough dislike to ardent spirit in the interior of living
bodies, that the instant it is introduced into their supply-pipes
and chambers, she goes hard to work to drive out the
unwelcome intruder. When men have been drinking much
fermented liquor, the fumes of ardent spirit are kept pouring
out through the waste-pipes that issue by the mouth, the
skin, and the kidneys; the fumes can commonly be smelt
under such circumstances in the breath.</p>

<p>When fermented liquors are drunk in a gradual way, but
yet in such quantity that the ardent spirit collects more rapidly
in the blood than it can be got rid of through the waste-pipes,
the fiery liquid produces step by step a series of remarkable
effects, growing continually more and more grave.</p>

<p>In order that all the actions of the living human body
may be properly carried on, three nerve overseers have been
appointed to dwell constantly in the frame and look after
different departments of its business. One of these has its
residence in the brain; that nerve-overseer has charge of
the reason, and all that belongs to it. Another resides under
the brain, just at the back of the face; that nerve-overseer
looks after all that relates to feeling or sense. The third
lives in the nerve-marrow of the backbone; that has to see
that the breathing and the pumping of the heart go on
steadily and constantly. Of these three superintendents
the brain-overseer and the sense-overseer are allowed certain
hours of repose at night; they are both permitted to
take their naps at proper times, because the reason and the
sense can alike be dispensed with for short intervals when
the creature is put safely to bed, or otherwise out of harm’s
way. Not so, however, with the breathing and blood-pumping
overseer. The breathing and the blood-movement
require to be kept going constantly; they must never cease,
even for a short interval, or the creature would die. Hence
the nerve-marrow overseer is a watchman as well as an
overseer. No sleep is allowed him. He must not even nap
at his post. If he do, his neglect and delinquency are immediately
discovered by a dreadful consequence. The
breathing and blood-flowing, which are his charge, stop,
and the living being, served by the breathing and the blood-streams,
chokes and faints.</p>

<p>These three nerve-overseers have been fitted to perform
their momentous tasks in the entire absence of ardent spirit,
and they are so constituted that they cannot perform those
tasks when ardent spirit is present in any great amount.
Ardent spirit puts them all to sleep. The reason-overseer is
overcome the most easily; he is the most given to napping
by nature, so he goes to sleep first. If more spirit be then
introduced into the blood, the sense-overseer begins to doze
also. And if yet more be introduced, the nerve-marrow
watchman ceases to be a watchman, and at length sleeps
heavily with his companions.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that you, my attentive reader, were in an
unlucky moment of weakness to turn aside from your usual
course of temperance and sobriety, and to drink fermented
liquor until its fiery spirit gathered in your brain, and put
your reason-overseer to sleep, what think you would be the
consequence? This would be the consequence—you would
for the time cease to be a reasonable being. You would
probably still walk about the streets, and go hither and
thither, and do all sorts of things. But all this you would
accomplish, not with a proper and rational knowledge of
your actions. Your reason and understanding being fast
asleep while you were walking about, you would properly
be living in a sort of brutal existence, instead of a human
and reasonable one. You would have laid aside the guide
who was intended to be your director in your responsible
human life, and you would be rashly trusting yourself in a
crowd of the most fearful dangers, all your responsibility
still upon your shoulders, without the inestimable advantage
of the advice and assistance of this experienced director.
Like the brutes, you would then find yourself to be
easily roused to the fiercest anger, and set upon the worst
courses of mischief; you would find yourself readily filled
with the most uncontrollable feelings of passion and violence,
and liable to be run away with by them at any moment,
and caused to do things that a rational creature could
not contemplate without the deepest anguish and shame.</p>

<p>There is no lack of proof that human beings do the most
brutish things when their reasons and understandings are
put to sleep by strong drink, while their sense-overseers and
their animal powers still remain active. Every place and
every day afford such in wretched abundance. One impressive
instance, however, may perhaps be related with advantage.
On the night of the 28th of June, 1856, two
drunken men, whose names were James and Andrew
Bracken, rushed brawling out from a beer shop in one of
the suburbs of Manchester. They ran against two inoffensive
passengers, and in their blind and brutish rage began
beating them; one was knocked down and kicked about the
head when on the ground. He was picked up thence a few
minutes afterward and carried to the hospital, where it was
found his skull had been broken. The poor fellow died in
the course of the night.</p>

<p>In the next assize court, at Liverpool, James and Andrew
Bracken stood in the dock to be tried for their brutal act.
The counsel who defended them said that it was only a
drunken row, and there was no murder in the case, because
neither of them knew what he was doing. The judge and
the jury, on the other hand, decided that this was no excuse,
because they <i>ought</i> to have known what they were
doing. They had laid aside their reason and become brutal
by their own voluntary act, and were therefore responsible
for any deed they might perform while in the brutal state.
The jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against Andrew
Bracken, and the judge passed sentence of death upon
him, coupling the sentence with these words: “You did
an act, the ordinary consequences of which must have been
to kill. It was a cruel and a brutal act, and you did it,
wholly reckless of consequences. You have therefore very
properly been convicted of wilful murder.” The wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
man was removed from the dock shrieking for mercy, with
upraised hands, and exclaiming in heartrending tones, “Oh!
mother, mother, that I should be hanged!” No doubt he was
very much surprised to find himself a condemned convict
and a murderer, and had never intended to be so. He had
no spite against his victim, and had probably never even exchanged
a word with him. No drunkard, therefore, when
about to put his reason to sleep by intoxicating liquor,
should ever overlook the fact that he will for the time cease
to have control over his actions, and that when that reason
awakes, he may find himself like Andrew Bracken, a prisoner
and a murderer. Whether he do so or not will depend
on no will or determination of his own, but upon the mere
series of accidents that will surround him while in his self-inflicted,
helpless, and brutal state.</p>

<p>The case of Andrew Bracken, sad and striking as it is,
by no means stands alone in the annals of crime. At the
assize, held at Lancaster in March, 1854, it was shown that
in that single court 380 cases of grave crime had been detected
and punished within a very short period, and that of
the 380 cases 250, including nine murders, were to be directly
traced to the influence of drunkenness.</p>

<p>But if having ceased to be sober, my strong-bodied reader,
you did not happen to commit murder, or do any other act
of gross violence while in the brutal stage of drunkenness,
yet nevertheless went on swallowing more and more of the
intoxicating liquid until your sense-overseer was put to
sleep as well as your reason-overseer, what do you think
would chance to you then? Why, you would have ceased
to be dangerous to your neighbors, and have become in a
like degree dangerous to yourself. You would no longer
have power to commit murder, or to do any other act of
cruelty, because you would sink down on the ground a
senseless and motionless lump of flesh. You would be what
the world calls dead-drunk. But you would not in reality
be dead, because the nerve-marrow watchman still continued
at his post, and awake. The lump of prostrate flesh would
still breathe heavily, and blood would be made to stream
sluggishly from its beating heart. In this insensible stage
of drunkenness, however, you would have ceased to be able
to exercise any care over yourself. In it the drunkard is
sunk as much lower than brutal life as the brutes are beneath
reasoning life, inasmuch as he ceases to be able to exert
the power which all brutes possess of perceiving the
threatening danger, and turning aside from its approach.</p>

<p>But yet again, rational reader, let us suppose that when
you became for the time a lump of insensible flesh, you had
already swallowed so much stupefying spirit, that there
was enough to put the nerve-marrow watchman to
sleep, as well as the reason- and sense-overseers, before
any fair quantity could be cleared away out of the waste-pipes
of the body. Under such circumstances breathing
would cease, and all heart-beating would stop. You would
then be dead-drunk in the full sense of the fearful term.
Senseless drunkenness is dangerous to the drunkard himself,
not only because he could not get out of the way if danger
were to come where he is lying, but also because he of necessity
is placed in an insensible state upon the brink of a
precipice, from the depth beneath which there could be no
return if he once rolled over. Whether he will ever again
awaken from his insensibility, or whether his earthly frame
shall have already commenced its endless sleep, is a question
which will be determined by the accident of a drop or two
more, or a drop or two less, of the stupefying spirit having
been mixed in with the coursing life-streams. The man
who kills a fellow-creature in a fit of drunken violence,
commits an act of murder; the man who dies in a fit of
drunken insensibility, is guilty of self-slaughter. In its first
degree, drunkenness is brutality; in its second degree, it is
senseless stupidity, of a lower kind than brutes ever know;
in its third degree, it is suicidal death. It will be felt that
it is important this matter should be looked fairly in the
face, when the statement is made that there are not less
than seventy thousand confirmed drunkards known to be
living at the present time in England and Wales.</p>

<p>It is now a well-proved and unquestionable fact, that a
young man of fair strength and health, who takes to hard
drinking at the age of twenty, can only look forward to fifteen
years more of life; while a temperate young man, of
the same age, may reasonably expect forty-five years more!
The habitual drunkard must therefore understand that,
amongst other things, he has to pay the heavy penalty of
thirty of the best years of existence, for the very questionable
indulgence that he buys. The doctor also has a sad account
to give of aches, and pains, and fevers, and weakness
that have to be borne by the intemperate during the few
years’ life they can claim. Whatever may be the true state
of the case with the moderate use of fermented liquors,
their intemperate use is a fertile source whence men draw
disease and suffering. Intemperance is another of the influences
whereby men cause sickness and decay to take the
place of health and strength. The doctor has likewise, it
must be remarked, a tale of his own to tell concerning the
beneficial power of fermented liquors, when employed as
medicines in certain weakened and already diseased states
of the body.</p>

<p>There is one earnest word which has yet to be addressed
to those who have satisfied their consciences that they may
with propriety indulge their inclination to use fermented
liquors in moderation habitually. Have they also satisfied
themselves that they can keep to the moderation their consciences
allow? Have they taken fairly and sufficiently
into consideration their own powers to resist urgent allurements?
Have they well weighed the possible influence, in
their own case, of the enticements which agreeable flavors
and pleasurable exhilaration necessarily bring into operation?
Have they sufficiently pondered upon the admitted
truth that there scarcely ever yet was a confirmed drunkard
who did not begin his vicious career by a very moderate employment
of the seductive liquors? If they have done this,
then let them still nevertheless go one step further and carefully
determine also for their own case, what moderation is,
and while doing this, let them never forget that when the
thirsty man drinks a pint of table beer, he pours a teaspoonful
of ardent spirit into his blood; when he drinks a pint
of strong ale he pours two tablespoonfuls of ardent spirit
into his blood; when he drinks four glasses of strong wine,
he pours one glass of ardent spirit into his blood; when he
drinks two glasses of rum, brandy, or gin, he pours from
three-quarters of a glass to a glass of ardent spirit into the
channels of his supply-pipes.</p>

<p>The habitual drinker of port wine has a more or less strong
fancy that his favorite and so-called “generous” beverage
fills him with “spirit” and “fire.” This fancy is indeed not
without some ground. Government has recently caused a
very careful examination to be made of the strength of the
port wines that are furnished to the English markets, and
the investigation has disclosed the startling and unexpected
fact that the weakest of these wines contains 26 per cent.;
ordinary specimens of them from 30 to 36 per cent.; choice
specimens 40 per cent.; and what are called the finest wines
as much as 56 per cent. of proof ardent spirit. The port wine
drinker therefore actually receives even more “spirit” and
“fire” with his ruby drink than he is himself aware he has
bargained for. There are rich flavor and delicious odor, no
doubt, in his wine, and so much the greater is his danger.
These serve only to conceal a wily enemy who is lurking beneath.
A bottle of ruby port wine in the stomach commonly
means half a bottle of poisonous fiery spirit in the
blood, and heart, and brain.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PARIS_WORKMAN" id="THE_PARIS_WORKMAN">THE PARIS WORKMAN.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By R. HEATH.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Like all the inhabitants of Paris, the workmen dwell in
houses of five or six stories high. The ground floor is let
out in shops, between which the principal staircase is entered
by a narrow passage. At the back there is a small
court-yard, skirted on one side by a wing from the main
building, of from two to three stories high. Each flat of the
main building and of its wing is occupied by several tenants,
so that such buildings contain on an average 50 different
tenants, with as many as from 120 to 150 inhabitants.
In one that I have visited there were 47 tenants, the total
number of persons in the building at night being 114.</p>

<p>Workmen inhabit all quarters of Paris, the better sort
preferring to live at some distance from their work. The
northeast of Paris is, however, peculiarly their quarter; the
suburb of St. Antoine and that of St. Martin, with the
districts known as La Villette and Belleville, are almost
entirely inhabited by workmen, and the tradespeople who
supply their wants. The neighborhood of the Canal Saint
Martin is altogether a different Paris to that usually seen by
the visitor. It has more of the cheerless look of our own
manufacturing districts; however, the bright sun of Paris,
the rows of trees, and the fountains prevent it from looking
gloomy or sad.</p>

<p>In this neighborhood lodging is not so dear as in the older
parts of the city. In very miserable and dirty streets in the
Latin quarter, the workman has to pay as much as thirty
dollars a year for a single room; two rooms cost him fifty-six
dollars a year; and two rooms and a little place, which
he can use as a kitchen, seventy-two dollars a year. This is
enormous, and amounts to about twenty per cent. of his income,
supposing him to work full time, and not to belong to
one of the more skilled trades.</p>

<p>The question of rent is one of the greatest grievances of
which Paris workmen have to complain. It keeps them in
poverty and anxiety, and, it is alleged, often drives the
whole family to moral ruin; the wife selling her honor to
obtain means, and the husband giving himself up in despair
to drink.</p>

<p>How impossible it is to settle questions which affect the
tenderest feelings of humanity by an assertion of the rights
of property, the following story strikingly illustrates:</p>

<p>During the siege of Paris the people universally fell into
poverty. On its termination a certain landlord, unable to
get his rents, determined to eject all the defaulters. He sent
an order to his agent to turn them out and sell their goods.
One was a widow with two children. Her husband had
died of a cold caught in the trenches. In her grief the poor
woman had vowed she would never be married again, and
as a sort of testimony of the truth of her intention she had
had their walnut bedstead sawn in half. When the time
came for the expulsion the proprietor arrived, and seeing
the best piece of furniture spoiled, upbraided her with ruining
his goods.</p>

<p>She found hospitality elsewhere, but the loss of the old
home and the household gods turned her brain. The insurrection
of the Commune broke out. She was one of the
first to rush to the scene and to join the insurgents. She
and her children were seen wherever there was peril. She
mounted the barricade, and planted the flag of the Commune
in the teeth of the besiegers. In one of the last days
of the defence her eldest son was separated from her in the
struggle, and the youngest was killed at her feet. Frantic,
she seized the body of the child, and springing up a barricade,
hurled it upon the bayonets of the soldiers, then tearing
open her dress she cried wildly, “Kill me! kill me!”
She fell over the stones, but was not dead. “Finish her!”
cried the young officer in charge.</p>

<p>A workman’s rooms are generally poorly furnished, but
clean; the custom being to spend a disproportionate amount
of income on food and clothing.</p>

<p>Living does not seem so costly in Paris as in London, yet
it is generally thought dear. Nevertheless the workman can
not be said to fare badly.</p>

<p>There are various modes and hours of taking meals in
Paris, depending chiefly on the nationality; for it must
never be forgotten that Paris is a cosmopolitan city, and
contains large numbers of workmen of German, Belgian,
and Italian origin.</p>

<p>The French mode is for the workman to leave home fasting,
taking his first two meals at a restaurant or cabaret near
the place where he is working. The second meal is eaten
about ten or eleven o’clock in the morning, and consists of
a plate of meat and vegetables and half a bottle of wine.
Any one walking about Paris at this hour of the day must
have observed workmen seated alone or in groups at the little
tables outside the restaurants, eating their breakfast.</p>

<p>The variety offered and the prices may be judged from the
following bill of fare, exposed in a street peculiarly frequented

<p>The workman’s wife has, with her children, an early
meal of milked coffee or soup, the children taking with
them to school sandwiches of bread and cheese, or something
from the previous day’s dinner. The mother takes a
similar breakfast in the middle of the day, the whole family
looking forward to the third meal, indiscriminately called
dinner or supper, as the principal one of the day. This consists
of soup, meat, vegetables or salad, cheese or prunes,
and fresh fruit according to the season.</p>

<p>Two or three times a week the kettle is put on, and rich
soup and boiled beef obtained. Thin soup is made from the
water in which the vegetables have been boiled, or with
onions, of which the Paris workman is fond. Wine is generally
drunk at supper, but when it is very dear a home-made
wine is obtained from raisins, or the wife and children
drink water in which liquorice root has been steeped.</p>

<p>Nearly every district in Paris has excellent markets, at
which all kinds of meat and poultry, vegetables and dairy
produce, can be bought at reasonable prices. There are
special days in which it is known certain articles will be
fresh and abundant.</p>

<p>In addition to the ordinary butchers’ shops, which in
Paris are always peculiarly clean and well arranged, there
are special shops for the sale of the flesh of horses, asses, and
mules. These shops are called horseflesh shops. There is
nothing in the least revolting in their appearance, the joints
looking like ordinary meat, only a little darker. It strikes
the eye at first as strange to see, “Ass, best quality,” but it
is a matter of habit.</p>

<p>The economical wife knows all the various pieces of meat
which are nourishing, some of which are little heard of in
England, such as beef’s stomach, veal’s mouth, sheep’s foot.</p>

<p>Vegetables are always plentiful in Paris, owing to the
quantity of market-garden land round the city, and for the
same reason there is a constant supply of salads all the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
round, but then the Parisians will make a salad of the leaves
of the lamb’s lettuce and the dandelion.</p>

<p>Another help in the domestic economy of the workman’s
home is the existence of the co-operative stores for the sale
of provisions. In 1870 there were three or four hundred
such societies in Paris.</p>

<p>The clothing and linen in a workman’s home are said to
equal in value his furniture. His own clothing costs him
about $24 a year; washing and mending raising the
cost by $12; the clothing of his wife and two children
would be about $44 more.</p>

<p>The workman’s wife is extremely industrious, rising early
and always assiduously engaged in domestic duties, or in
some work by which she adds to the income.</p>

<p>Many workmen with small families are able to save sufficient
to set their wives up in business as washerwomen, or
in a fruit or newspaper stall. Often she undertakes the duties
of a housekeeper, <i>i. e.</i>, acting as general servant for the
first few hours of the day in some family of the middle class.
When she thus works she has to send her children to the
crib or to the asylum; but this is not frequent, as the families
of workmen in Paris are usually very small.</p>

<p>Those who have the largest are generally of German origin,
coming from Alsace, Belgium, and countries bordering
on the Rhine. That very large families sometimes are
found among workmen in Paris is proved by one case where
a day laborer, a native of the department of the Haut-Rhin,
received a prize of $600 for bringing up a family
of fifteen children respectably on a wage of fifty cents
a day. In the end he was assisted by his son, who
was able to earn as a skilled workman more than his
father.</p>

<p>As a rule the workman leaves the management of the
children and the spending of the money entirely to his wife.
He gives her all the wages on pay-day, and she doles out to
him every morning the sum necessary for his meals.</p>

<p>Sometimes she finds a great deficit when this time comes.
Then she weeps and upbraids him, while he, confessing his
fault, says reproachfully of himself, “One must not deceive
when one has five or six children.”</p>

<p>It does not appear to be easy to outwit a French woman.
Occasionally a drinking husband will try to hide a piece of
money in some out of the way place, as, for instance, the
peak of his hat. But his wife ransacks his clothes while he
is asleep and finds the missing coin. This position of affairs
being well known, the workman who will not be entrapped
into drinking, or who, being one of a social gathering, insists
on going home early, is chaffed as a man who buttons
up his coat with pins.</p>

<p>It is certainly a fact that feminine influence is very powerful
in Paris, and that what the mother is the home becomes.
Thus while Paris workmen almost universally absent
themselves from the churches, and throw all their influence
politically against the priests, their children go in
crowds to make their first communion, and to this end are
placed under the priests for religious instruction.</p>

<p>To see the street in front of a Paris church on Whit Sunday,
no one would believe religion was a matter not only
of indifference, but of contempt, to the Paris workman. The
road seen from a balcony is like an immense field of snow-drops.
Hundreds of white-robed children float about among
crowds of smiling parents and friends. And yet there is
hardly anything in it beyond a domestic rite, something
which it is respectable to go through at a certain age.</p>

<p>“I will sell my clothes, but my child shall not be different
from others,” says a mother, who, no more than her
husband, considers the spiritual aspect of the ceremony.</p>

<p>The domestic affections of the workman, where he has
not been demoralized by licentiousness or vice, are strong,
and his sense of duty to his relatives unusual. Thus it
would seem not at all uncommon for a workman to support his
wife’s mother, even when she lives far away. A workman
who had done this for some time fell, through the state of
public affairs, into such distress as to be obliged to earn his
bread by selling journals in the street. After a time he recovered
his position; but all through his period of poverty,
the mother-in-law was allowed to believe that no change
had taken place in his circumstances. Another workman,
who had originally been in business as a butcher, partly
ruined himself by undertaking the charge of his wife’s family.
However, he never forsook the mother-in-law, but
when he had a numerous family and only the small and
precarious wages of a day laborer, she remained as much
part of his family as the children.</p>

<p>The workman is careful of his children. He will fetch his
daughter, apprenticed to dressmaking, from her work in the
evening, and likes to have his son follow the same business
as himself. He respects his own art, and has no desire to
see his boy made into a clerk. If his wife is foolish enough
to express such a wish he rates her soundly. “Does she
want to make a skip-kennel (errand boy) of him because one
gets dirty in factory work?”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest,” he concludes, “I always consider what
thou sayest, but candidly, thou art unreasonable—wouldst
thou then have him die of hunger when he is grown up? To
slave at a desk is a miserable business; one ought to have
a manual trade, with that a man always has his living at
his fingers’ ends. Why! thou hast never said I was too
dirty for thee; ah! I should like to see him a clerk. And to
think that there are people who pretend that the woman
has as much judgment as the man. Yes, yes, thou art a
very good sort of a woman, but at bottom thou knowest
nothing. Henri shall be a mechanic; the devil may burn
me if ever he becomes a scribbling puppet.”—<i>Good Words.</i></p>

<h3>THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.</h3>


<p>There lived in the city of Verona two young gentlemen,
whose names were Valentine and Protheus, between whom
a firm and uninterrupted friendship had long subsisted.
They pursued their studies together, and their hours of leisure
were always passed in each other’s company, except
when Protheus visited a lady he was in love with; and these
visits, and this passion of Protheus for the fair Julia, were
the only topics on which these two friends disagreed: for
Valentine, not being himself a lover, was sometimes a little
weary of hearing his friend forever talking of his Julia, and
then he would laugh at Protheus, and in pleasant terms
ridicule the passion of love, and declare that no such idle
fancies should ever enter his head, greatly preferring (as he
said) the free and happy life he lead, to the anxious hopes
and fears of the lover Protheus.</p>

<p>One morning Valentine came to Protheus, to tell him that
they must for a time be separated, for that he was going to
Milan. Protheus, unwilling to part with his friend, used
many arguments to prevail upon Valentine not to leave
him; but Valentine said, “Cease to persuade me, my loving
Protheus, I will not, like a sluggard, wear out my youth in
idleness at home. Home-keeping youths have ever homely
wits. If your affection were not chained to the sweet glances
of your honored Julia, I would entreat you to accompany
me, to see the wonders of the world abroad; but since
you are a lover, love on still, and may your love be prosperous!”
They parted with mutual expressions of unalterable
friendship. “Sweet Valentine, adieu!” said Protheus;
“think on me, when you see some rare object worthy of
notice in your travels, and wish me partaker of your happiness.”</p>

<p>Valentine began his journey that same day towards Milan;
and when his friend had left him, Protheus sat down
to write a letter to Julia, which he gave to her maid Lucetta
to deliver to her mistress. Julia loved Protheus as
well as he did her, but she was a lady of a noble spirit, and
she thought it did not become her maiden dignity too easily
to be won; therefore she affected to be insensible of his passion,
and gave him much uneasiness in the prosecution of
his suit. And when Lucetta offered the letter to Julia, she
would not receive it, and chid her maid for taking letters
from Protheus, and ordered her to leave the room. But she
so much wished to see what was written in the letter, that
she soon called in her maid again, and when Lucetta returned,
she said, “What o’clock is it?” Lucetta, who knew
her mistress more desired to see the letter than to know the
time of day, without answering her question, again offered
the rejected letter. Julia, angry that her maid should thus
take the liberty of seeming to know what she really wanted,
tore the letter in pieces, and threw it on the floor, ordering
her maid once more out of the room. As Lucetta was retiring,
she stopped to pick up the fragments of the torn letter;
but Julia, who meant not so to part with them, said, in
pretended anger, “Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie;
you would be fingering them to anger me.”</p>

<p>Julia then began to piece together as well as she could the
torn fragments. She first made out these words, “Love-wounded
Protheus;” and lamenting over these and such-like
loving words, which she made out though they were all
torn asunder, or she said, wounded (the expression “Love-wounded
Protheus,” giving her that idea), she talked to
these kind words, telling them she would lodge them in her
bosom as in a bed, till their wounds were healed, and that
she would kiss each several piece, to make amends. In this
manner she went on talking with a pretty lady-like childishness,
till finding herself unable to make out the whole,
and vexed at her own ingratitude in destroying such sweet
and loving words, as she called them, she wrote a much
kinder letter to Protheus than she had ever done before.</p>

<p>Protheus was greatly delighted at receiving this favorable
answer to his letter; and while he was reading it, he exclaimed,
“Sweet love, sweet lines, sweet life!” In the
midst of his raptures he was interrupted by his father.
“How now!” said the old gentleman, “what letter are you
reading there?” “My lord,” replied Protheus, “it is a letter
from my friend Valentine, at Milan.” “Lend me the
letter,” said his father; “let me see what news.” “There are
no news, my lord,” said Protheus, greatly alarmed, “but
that he writes how well beloved he is of the Duke of Milan,
who daily graces him with favors; and how he wishes me
with him, the partner of his fortune.” “And how stand
you affected to his wish?” asked the father. “As one relying
on your lordship’s will, and not depending on his
friendly wish,” said Protheus.</p>

<p>Now it had happened that Protheus’s father had just been
talking with a friend on this very subject: his friend had
said, he wondered his lordship suffered his son to spend his
youth at home, whilst most men were sending their sons to
seek preferment abroad; “some,” said he, “to the wars, to
try their fortunes there, and some to discover islands far
away, and some to study in foreign universities; and there
is his companion Valentine, he is gone to the Duke of Milan’s
court. Your son is fit for any of these things, and it
will be a great disadvantage to him in his riper age, not to
have traveled in his youth.”</p>

<p>Protheus’s father thought the advice of his friend was
very good, and upon Protheus telling him that Valentine
“wished him with him, the partner of his fortune,” he at
once determined to send his son to Milan; and without giving
Protheus any reason for this sudden resolution, it being
the usual habit of this positive old gentleman to command
his son, not reason with him, he said, “My will is the same
as Valentine’s wish:” and seeing his son look astonished,
he added, “Look not amazed, that I so suddenly resolve
you shall spend some time in the Duke of Milan’s court;
for what I will I will, and there is an end. To-morrow be
in readiness to go. Make no excuses, for I am peremptory.”
Protheus knew it was of no use to make objections to his
father, who never suffered him to dispute his will; and he
blamed himself for telling his father an untruth about
Julia’s letter, which had brought upon him the sad necessity
of leaving her.</p>

<p>Now that Julia found she was going to lose Protheus for so
long a time, she no longer pretended indifference; and they
bade each other a mournful farewell with many vows of love
and constancy. Protheus and Julia exchanged rings, which
they both promised to keep forever in remembrance of each
other; and thus, taking a sorrowful leave, Protheus set out
on his journey to Milan, the abode of his friend Valentine.</p>

<p>Valentine was in reality what Protheus had feigned to his
father, in high favor with the duke of Milan; and another
event had happened to him, of which Protheus did not
even dream, for Valentine had given up the freedom of which
he used so much to boast, and was become as passionate a
lover as Protheus. She who had wrought this wondrous
change in Valentine, was the lady Silvia, daughter of the
duke of Milan, and she also loved him; but they concealed
their love from the duke, because although he showed much
kindness to Valentine, and invited him every day to his
palace, yet he designed to marry his daughter to a young
courtier whose name was Thurio. Silvia despised this
Thurio, for he had none of the fine sense and excellent qualities
of Valentine.</p>

<p>These two rivals, Thurio and Valentine, were one day on
a visit to Silvia, and Valentine was entertaining Silvia with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
turning everything Thurio said into ridicule, when the duke
himself entered the room, and told Valentine the welcome
news of his friend Protheus’s arrival. Valentine said, “If
I had wished a thing, it would have been to have seen him
here!” and then he highly praised Protheus to the duke,
saying, “My lord, though I have been a truant of my time,
yet hath my friend made use and fair advantage of his days,
and is complete in person and in mind, in all good grace to
grace a gentleman.” “Welcome him then according to his
worth,” said the duke; “Silvia, I speak to you, and you,
sir Thurio; for Valentine, I need not bid him do so.” They
were here interrupted by the entrance of Protheus, and Valentine
introduced him to Silvia, saying, “Sweet lady, entertain
him to be my fellow servant to your ladyship.”</p>

<p>When Valentine and Protheus had ended their visit, and
were alone together, Valentine said, “Now tell me how all
does from whence you came? How does your lady, and
how thrives your love?” Protheus replied, “My tales of
love used to weary you, I know you joy not in a love-discourse.”
“Ay, Protheus,” returned Valentine, “but that
life is altered now. I have done penance for condemning
love. For in revenge of my contempt of Love, Love has
chased sleep from my enthralled eyes. O gentle Protheus,
Love is a mighty lord, and hath so humbled me, that I confess
there is no woe like his correction, and no such joy on
earth as in his service. I now like no discourse except it be
of love. Now I can break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep,
upon the very name of love.”</p>

<p>This acknowledgment of the change which love had made
in the disposition of Valentine was a great triumph to his
friend Protheus. But “friend” Protheus must be called no
longer, for the same all-powerful deity, Love, of whom they
were speaking, (yea even while they were talking of the
change he had made in Valentine) was working in the heart
of Protheus; and he, who had till this time been a pattern
of true love and perfect friendship, was now, in one short
interview with Silvia, become a false friend and a faithless
lover; for at the first sight of Silvia, all his love for Julia
vanished away like a dream, nor did his long friendship for
Valentine deter him from endeavoring to supplant him in
her affections; and although, as it will always be, when
people of dispositions naturally good become unjust, he had
many scruples, before he determined to forsake Julia, and
become the rival of Valentine, yet he at length overcame
his sense of duty, and yielded himself up, almost without
remorse, to his new unhappy passion.</p>

<p>Valentine imparted to him in confidence the whole history
of his love, and how carefully they had concealed it
from the duke her father, and told him, that despairing of
ever being able to obtain his consent, he had prevailed upon
Silvia to leave her father’s palace that night, and go with
him to Mantua; then he showed Protheus a ladder of ropes,
by help of which he meant to assist Silvia to get out of one
of the windows of the palace, after it was dark.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this faithful recital of his friend’s dearest
secrets, it is hardly possible to be believed, but so it was,
that Protheus resolved to go to the duke and disclose
the whole to him. This false friend began his tale with
many artful speeches to the duke, such as that by the laws
of friendship he ought to conceal what he was going to reveal,
but that the gracious favor the duke had shown him,
and the duty he owed his grace, urged him to tell that,
which else no worldly good should draw from him; he
then told all he had heard from Valentine, not omitting the
ladder of ropes, and the manner in which Valentine meant
to conceal them under a long cloak.</p>

<p>The duke thought Protheus quite a miracle of integrity, in
that he preferred telling his friend’s intention rather than
he would conceal an unjust action, highly commended him,
and promised him not to let Valentine know from whom he
had learned this intelligence, but by some artifice to make
Valentine betray the secret himself. For this purpose the
duke awaited the coming of Valentine in the evening, whom
he soon saw hurrying toward the palace, and he perceived
somewhat was wrapped within his cloak, which he concluded
was the rope ladder.</p>

<p>The duke upon this stopped him, saying, “Whither away
so fast, Valentine?” “May it please your grace,” said Valentine,
“there is a messenger, that stays to bear my letters
to my friends, and I am going to deliver them.” Now this
falsehood of Valentine’s had no better success in the event
than the untruth Protheus told his father. “Be they of
much import,” said the duke. “No more, my lord,” said
Valentine, “than to tell my father I am well and happy at
your grace’s court.” “Nay, then,” said the duke, “no matter;
stay with me awhile. I wish your counsel about some
affairs that concern me nearly.” He then told Valentine
an artful story, as a prelude to draw his secret from him,
saying, that Valentine knew he wished to match his
daughter with Thurio, but that she was stubborn and disobedient
to his commands, “neither regarding,” said he
“that she is my child, nor fearing me as if I were her father.
And I may say to thee, that this pride of hers has drawn my
love from her. I had thought my age should have been
cherished by her child-like duty. I am now resolved to
take a wife, and turn her out to whomsoever will take her
in. Let her beauty be her wedding-dower, for me and my
possessions she esteems not.”</p>

<p>Valentine, wondering where all this would end, made answer.
“And what would your grace have me do in all
this?” “Why,” said the duke, “the lady I would wish to
marry is nice and coy, and does not much esteem my aged
eloquence. Besides, the fashion of courtship is much
changed since I was young; now I would willingly have
you to be my tutor to instruct me how I am to woo.” Valentine
gave him a general idea of the modes of courtship then
practiced by young men, when they wished to win a fair
lady’s love, such as presents, frequent visits, and the like.
The duke replied to this, that the lady did not refuse a
present which he sent her, and that she was so strictly kept
by her father, that no man might have access to her by day.
“Why then,” said Valentine, “you must visit her by night.”
“By night,” said the artful duke, who was now coming to
the drift of his discourse, “her doors are fast locked.”</p>

<p>Valentine then unfortunately proposed that the duke
should get into the lady’s chamber at night, by means of a
ladder of ropes, saying, he would procure him one fitting
for that purpose; and, in conclusion, advised him to conceal
this ladder of ropes under such a cloak as that which he
now wore. “Lend me your cloak,” said the duke, who had
feigned this long story on purpose to have a pretence to get
off the cloak; so, upon saying these words, he caught hold
of Valentine’s cloak, and throwing it back, he discovered
not only the ladder of ropes, but also a letter of Silvia’s
which he instantly opened and read; and this letter contained
a full account of their intended elopement. The
duke, after upbraiding Valentine for his ingratitude in thus
returning the favor he had shown him, by endeavoring to
steal away his daughter, banished him from the court and
city of Milan forever; and Valentine was forced to depart
that night, without even seeing Silvia.</p>

<p>While Protheus at Milan was thus injuring Valentine,
Julia at Verona was regretting the absence of Protheus, and
her regard for him at last so far overcame her sense of propriety,
that she resolved to leave Verona, and seek her lover
at Milan; and to secure herself from danger on the road,
she dressed her maid Lucetta and herself in men’s clothes,
and they set out in this disguise, and arrived at Milan soon
after Valentine was banished from that city, through the
treachery of Protheus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia entered Milan about noon, and she took up her abode
at an inn; and her thoughts being all on her dear Protheus,
she entered into conversation with the inn-keeper, or host,
as he was called, thinking by that means to learn some
news of Protheus. The host was greatly pleased that this
handsome young gentleman (as he took her to be), who
from his appearance he concluded was of high rank, spoke
so familiarly to him; and being a good-natured man, he
was sorry to see him look so melancholy; and to amuse his
young guest he offered to take him to hear some fine music,
with which, he said, a gentleman that evening was going to
serenade his mistress.</p>

<p>The reason Julia looked so very melancholy was, that she
did not well know what Protheus would think of the imprudent
step she had taken; for she knew that he had loved her for
her noble maiden pride and dignity of character, and she
feared she should lower herself in his esteem; and this it
was that made her wear a sad and thoughtful countenance.</p>

<p>She gladly accepted the offer of the host to go with him,
and hear the music; for she secretly hoped she might meet
Protheus by the way. But when she came to the palace
whither the host conducted her, a very different effect was
produced to what the kind host intended; for there, to her
heart’s sorrow, she beheld her lover, the inconstant Protheus,
serenading the lady Silvia with music, and addressing
discourse of love and admiration to her. And Julia
overheard Silvia from a window talk with Protheus, and
reproach him for forsaking his own true lady, and for his
ingratitude to his friend Valentine; and then Silvia left
the window, not choosing to listen to his music and his fine
speeches; for she was a faithful lady to her banished Valentine,
and abhorred the ungenerous conduct of his false
friend Protheus.</p>

<p>Though Julia was in despair at what she had just witnessed,
yet did she still love the truant Protheus; and hearing
that he had lately parted with a servant, she contrived,
with the assistance of her host, the innkeeper, to hire herself
to Protheus as a page; and Protheus knew not she was
Julia, and he sent her with letters and presents to her rival
Silvia, and he even sent by her the very ring she gave him
as a parting gift at Verona.</p>

<p>When she went to that lady with the ring, she was most
glad to find that Silvia utterly rejected the suit of Protheus;
and Julia, or the page Sebastian, as she was called, entered
into conversation with Silvia about Protheus’s first love,
the forsaken lady Julia. She putting in (as one may say) a
good word for herself, said she knew Julia; as well she
might, being herself the Julia of whom she spoke: telling
how fondly Julia loved her master Protheus, and how his
unkind neglect would grieve her. And then she, with a
pretty equivocation, went on: “Julia is about my height,
and of my complexion, the color of her eyes and hair the
same as mine;” and indeed Julia looked a most beautiful
youth in her boy’s attire. Silvia was moved to pity this
lovely lady, who was so sadly forsaken by the man she
loved; and when Julia offered the ring which Protheus had
sent, refused it, saying, “The more shame for him that he
sends me that ring; I will not take it, for I have often heard
him say his Julia gave it to him. I love thee, gentle youth,
for pitying her, poor lady! Here is a purse; I give it you
for Julia’s sake.” These comfortable words coming from
her kind rival’s tongue cheered the drooping heart of the
disguised lady.</p>

<p>But to return to the banished Valentine, who scarce knew
which way to bend his course, being unwilling to return
home to his father a disgraced and banished man. As he
was wandering over a lonely forest, not far distant from
Milan, where he had left his heart’s dear treasure, the lady
Silvia, he was set upon by robbers, who demanded his
money. Valentine told them he was a man crossed by adversity,
that he was going into banishment, and that he had
no money, the clothes he had on being all his riches. The
robbers, hearing that he was a distressed man, and being
struck with his noble air and manly behavior, told him, if
he would live with them and be their chief, or captain, they
would put themselves under his command, but if he refused
to accept their offer they would kill him. Valentine, who
cared little what became of himself, said he would consent
to live with them and be their captain, provided they
did no outrage on women or poor passengers. Thus the
noble Valentine became, like Robin Hood, of whom we
read in ballads, a captain of robbers and outlawed banditti;
and in this situation he was found by Silvia, and in this
manner it came to pass:</p>

<p>Silvia, to avoid a marriage with Thurio, whom her father
insisted upon her no longer refusing, came at last to the resolution
of following Valentine to Mantua, at which place
she had heard her lover had taken refuge; but in this account
she was misinformed, for he still lived in the forest
among the robbers, bearing the name of their captain, but
taking no part in their depredations, and using the authority
which they had imposed upon him in no other way than
to show compassion to the travelers they robbed. Silvia
contrived to effect her escape from her father’s palace in
company with a worthy old gentleman, whose name was
Eglamour, whom she took along with her for protection on
the road. She had to pass through the forest where Valentine
and the banditti dwelt; and one of the robbers seized
on Silvia, and would also have taken Eglamour, but he escaped.</p>

<p>The robber who had taken Silvia, seeing the terror she
was in, bid her not to be alarmed, for that he was only going
to carry her to a cave where his captain lived, and that she
need not be afraid, for their captain had an honorable mind,
and always showed humanity to women. Silvia found little
comfort in hearing she was going to be carried as a prisoner
before the captain of a lawless banditti. “O Valentine,”
she cried, “this I endure for thee!” But as the robber
was conveying her to the cave of his captain, he was
stopped by Protheus, who, still attended by Julia in the disguise
of a page, having heard of the flight of Silvia, had
traced her steps to this forest. Protheus now rescued her
from the hands of the robber, but scarce had she time to
thank him for the service he had done her, before he began
to distress her afresh with his love suit; and while he was
rudely pressing her to consent to marry him, and his page
(the forlorn Julia) was standing beside them in great anxiety
of mind, fearing lest the great service which Protheus
had just done to Silvia should win her to show him some
favor, they were all strangely surprised with the sudden appearance
of Valentine, who having heard his robbers had
taken a lady prisoner, came to console and relieve her.</p>

<p>Protheus was courting Silvia, and he was so much ashamed
of being caught by his friend, that he was all at once seized
with penitence and remorse; and he expressed such a lively
sorrow for the injuries he had done to Valentine, that Valentine,
whose nature was noble and generous, even to a romantic
degree, not only forgave and restored him to his former
place in his friendship, but in a sudden flight of heroism
he said, “I freely do forgive you; and all the interest I
have in Silvia, I give it up to you.” Julia, who was standing
behind her master as a page, hearing this strange offer,
and fearing Protheus would not be able with this new found
virtue to refuse Silvia, fainted, and they were all employed
in recovering her; else would Silvia have been offended at
being thus made over to Protheus, though she could scarcely
think that Valentine would long persevere in this over-strained
and too generous act of friendship. When Julia
recovered from the fainting fit, she said, “I had forgotten,
my master ordered me to deliver this ring to Silvia.” Protheus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
looking upon the ring, saw that it was the one he
gave to Julia, in return for that which he received from her,
and which he had sent by the supposed page to Silvia.
“How is this?” said he, “this is Julia’s ring; how came you
by it, boy?” Julia answered, “Julia herself did give it me,
and Julia herself hath brought it hither.”</p>

<p>Protheus, now looking earnestly upon her, plainly perceived
that the page Sebastian was no other than the lady
Julia herself; and the proof she had given of her constancy
and true love so wrought in him, that his love for her returned
into his heart, and he took again his own dear lady,
and joyfully resigned all pretensions to the lady Silvia to
Valentine, who had so well deserved her.</p>

<p>Protheus and Valentine were expressing their happiness
in their reconciliation, and in the love of their faithful
ladies, when they were surprised with the sight of the Duke
of Milan and Thurio, who came there in pursuit of Silvia.
Thurio first approached, and attempted to seize Silvia, saying,
“Silvia is mine.” Upon this Valentine said to him in
a very spirited manner, “Thurio, keep back; if once again
you say that Silvia is yours, you shall embrace your death.
Here she stands; take but possession of her with a touch!
I dare you but to breathe upon my love.” Hearing this
threat, Thurio, who was a great coward, drew back, and
said he cared not for her, and that none but a fool would
fight for a girl who loved him not.</p>

<p>The duke, who was a very brave man himself, said now
in great anger, “The more base and degenerate in you to
take such means for her as you have done, and leave her on
such slight conditions.” Then turning to Valentine, he
said, “I do applaud your spirit, Valentine, and think you
worthy of an empress’s love. You shall have Silvia, for you
have well deserved her.” Valentine then with great humility
kissed the duke’s hand, and accepted the noble present
which he had made him of his daughter with becoming
thankfulness; taking occasion of this joyful minute to entreat
the good-humored duke to pardon the thieves with
whom he had associated in the forest, assuring him that
when reformed and restored to society, there would be found
among them many good, and fit for great employment, for
the most of them had been banished, like Valentine, for
state offences, rather than for any black crimes they had
been guilty of. To this the ready duke consented; and now
nothing remained but that Protheus, the false friend, was
ordained, by way of penance for his love-prompted faults,
to be present at the recital of the whole story of his loves
and falsehoods before the duke. And the shame of the recital
to his awakened conscience was judged sufficient punishment;
which being done, the lovers, all four, returned
back to Milan, and their nuptials were solemnized in presence
of the duke, with high triumphs and feasting.</p>

<h2><a name="CONSTANT_CHANGE_IN_WORDS" id="CONSTANT_CHANGE_IN_WORDS">CONSTANT CHANGE IN WORDS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By JOHN PEILE, M. A.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Words are subject to an incessant change. Substantives,
for example, are the names of things actually existing, or
of qualities of those things. When I say an oak, I mean
an oak and not a beech; goodness is not badness; and if
these things don’t change, how can the names which express
them change without causing utter confusion? Perhaps
variations so violent as these are not very common,
and yet both these changes have occurred in language. The
very same word which to the Greeks meant an oak, to the
Romans meant a beech, though an oak never yet changed
into a beech. <i>Schlecht</i> in German first of all meant
“straight.” Now the “straightness” of a visible object, such
as a line, is the most obvious metaphor by which to express
the moral idea of “straightforwardness” and simplicity of
heart and purpose, just as our common word <i>right</i> means
originally that which is straight, the Latin <i>rectus</i>. But
then simpleness may shade into the folly of the simpleton;
and lastly the fool in worldly wisdom may give his name
to the fool of whom Solomon spoke; and by some such process
as this <i>schlecht</i> in modern German means “bad” only.
After seeing this change of nouns, can we wonder that verbs
can vary their meaning by imperceptible degrees so much
that the first sense would be altogether unrecognizable unless
we had the history of the word recorded by its use in
successive writers?</p>

<p>Great changes of language are sometimes due to great
convulsions in history; as when the Roman civilization was
destroyed by nations comparatively uncivilized and the
language of the Romans remained modified in different
ways in the countries of which they were the lords no
longer. Such great changes do not often take place; yet
just as surely, though more slowly, a gradual change goes
on in the most peaceful times, of which you cannot have a
better example than in your own English. “Well,” you
say, “surely English has not changed much in the last three
hundred years. We can read Shakspere without any difficulty.”
That is saying a little too much; we are so familiar
with the best parts of Shakspere that perhaps we are hardly
conscious of the difference; the words have a well-known
sound, and if we are not students of language we may not
examine them very carefully. But open your Shakspere
almost at random and you will soon find out, if you really
consider, how much is now obsolete, how many words have
passed out of use or are used in a different sense. I have
opened on “Macbeth,” Act. i. Sec. 7, and there I find in Lady
Macbeth’s speech:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 5em;">“His two chamberlains</span></div>
<div class="verse">Will I with wine and wassail so convince</div>
<div class="verse">That memory, the warder of the brain,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason</div>
<div class="verse">A limbec only.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now look at a few of the words here. (1) “Chamberlain,” as
we all know, etymologically a man of the chamber; it comes
from <i>camera</i>, a chamber, originally a vault; the root of this
is <i>cam</i>—to be bent or crooked, which is supposed to be the
origin of the name of our most crooked river. The old
sense of “chamberlain” has not quite died out of our recollection;
yet when we speak of the Lord Chamberlain—the
only person to whom the title is now applied—we don’t
think of a man whose business it is to guard his king’s sleep
when on a journey, or, generally, of a bed-room attendant,
but of one whose best known duty is the censorship of plays.
(2) “Wassail” is a word which we should expect to find
in a historical novel, but not to hear in every-day talk. We
feel pretty sure that it has something to do with good cheer,
but we may not know that it was originally a drinking of
health; that <i>was</i> was the imperative of the verb <i>was</i> “to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
be,” which we have turned into an auxiliary verb to mark
past time; and the last syllable is our word <i>hale</i>—healthy,
which we have pretty well restricted to the description of
an elderly man, whom we call “hale for his years;” though
we are familiar with the word in corrupted form <i>whole</i>, which
we have in the Bible, “I have made a man every whit
whole on the Sabbath day.” (3) “Convince” has wavered
much in sense; we use it now simply for persuading a person,
but the primary meaning was “to overpower,” which
it has here; in the Bible phrase “Which of you <i>convinceth</i>
me of sin?” we have the same special sense of overcoming
by testimony, which <i>convincere</i> had in Latin.</p>

<p>So again (4) “Warder,” like “wassail” is a word with which
we are familiar from books, but which we should not ourselves
use without the appearance of affectation; we should use
the equivalent “guard.” We have here a couple of words
identical in meaning, just as we have <i>wise</i> and <i>guise</i>, <i>warrant</i>
and <i>guarantee</i>, <i>wager</i> and <i>gaze</i>, and others which explain
the riddle, such as <i>war</i> and French <i>guerre</i>, <i>warren</i>
and French <i>garenne</i>. It is well known that in all these the
<i>w</i> marks the Teutonic word introduced alike into England
by the Anglo-Saxons and into France by the Franks, which
the earlier inhabitants of France were unable to pronounce
without letting a <i>g</i> escape before it; and so they produced
the second form beginning with <i>gu</i>. Some of these second
forms were brought into England by the Normans, and existed
there by the side of the English word brought long before;
but as there was no distinction in sense, one form generally
fell into disuse, only to be revived for a special purpose, as
by Sir Walter Scott, to give a mediæval look to his poems.</p>

<p>(5) “Fume” meant smoke or steam. Shakspere used it metaphorically,
just as we might speak of a man’s reason being
clouded. Such a use of the word may have been familiar at
his time, but no such idea would now attach to it; if we use
it at all, we do so in the old simple sense, as the “fumes of
tobacco,” the same sense which the word bore at Rome and
in the far-away India more than twenty centuries ago;
while the Greeks turned it, by a different metaphor, to express
the steam of passion, and Plato in his famous analysis
distinguished the “thumoeides,” the spirited part of the
soul, from that part which reasons, and from that part which
desires. (6) “Receipt” seems to be used of a place, that
place where reason is found, just as we hear of Matthew in
the Bible “sitting at the receipt of custom.” (7) “Limbec”
has probably died out altogether. It is only the student of the
history of the English language who can guess that the word
is equivalent to <i>alembic</i>, which meant a still or retort, and
so is used here by Shakspere merely in the sense of an
empty vessel, that into which anything may be poured.
The word is Arabic; it was brought into England with
chemical study like <i>alchemy</i> itself, <i>algebra</i>, and many
others. Then by degrees people fancied that the <i>a</i> at the
beginning of the word was our article, though really the
first syllable <i>al</i> is the Arabic article; and thus <i>lembic</i>
or <i>limbic</i> was left. The article has often been a thief in
England. It has two forms <i>an</i> and <i>a</i>, and meant <i>one</i>, as
you may see in the old Scotch form, “ane high and michty
lord.” The shortened form <i>a</i> was naturally used before a
consonant, but when the word began with <i>n</i>, people did not
always see where to divide rightly. Thus <i>a nadder</i> turned
into <i>an adder</i>, <i>a napron</i> has become <i>an apron</i>, etc.; on the
other hand the <i>eft</i> (ewt) seems to have robbed the article in
its turn and become <i>a newt</i>.</p>

<p>Thus we have examined one passage, and have found in
its four lines seven words which are either not used now at
all or are used in a different sense. Yet, as we said, the
passage as a whole sounds simple enough when we read it
or hear it on the stage. We must admit then that the English
of to-day differs much from Shakspere’s English in the
meaning of its words.</p>

<h2><a name="ARCHERY_IN_SCOTLAND" id="ARCHERY_IN_SCOTLAND">ARCHERY IN SCOTLAND.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By ROBERT MACGREGOR.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Though it has often been hastily assumed that the annals
of the bow in the northern kingdom would require no more
space in the writing than did Olaus Magnus’s famous chapter
on the snakes of Iceland, yet this is only true of archery
in battle; and it is a curious fact that, though the Scots
could never be induced to take to the bow as a military
weapon, they became very fond of archery as a pastime,
when firearms took the place of bows and arrows as “artilyere,”
and there was no further need of statutes forcing
the bow into their hands, and forbidding all outdoor amusements
that interfered with its practice. It is a curious
problem why, in two races so akin as the English and the
Lowland Scots, national bent should in this respect take
such opposite directions. While the southern yeoman delighted
in his long-bow and the sheaf of shafts—“the twelve
Scots’ lives” he bore under his girdle—his kinsman foe
across the Tweed could never be compelled either by experience
or a long series of penal statutes to take to the weapon
whose power in skilful hands he had felt on many a bloody
field. “Few of thaim was sekyr of archarie,” laments Blind
Harry, the minstrel, of Wallace’s followers; and not only
was this true of all succeeding Scottish soldiers, but it may
be that the same national prejudice can be traced back for
centuries before the Blind Minstrel’s time, to the days of
the sculptured stones that stud the northeastern districts of
Scotland. While on them are many delineations of the
hunter aiming his arrow at deer or wild boar, there is only
one instance, in all their many scenes of war, in which
fighting men are armed with the bow.</p>

<p>When the first James of Scotland returned to his northern
kingdom with his “fairest English flower,” Lady Jane
Beaufort, he brought back with him from his long captivity
a deep impression of the value of the bow. Under the careful
instruction of the constable of Pevensey, James had become
a fine marksman, and he tried by every means in his
power to popularize the exercise at home. He forbade football
and other “unprofitable sports;” he ordered every man
to shoot at the bow marks near his parish church every Sunday;
he chose a bodyguard for himself from among the
most skilful archers at the periodical “Wappinshaws;” and
in his poem of “Christ’s Kirk on the Green” he published
a scathing satire on the clumsiness and inefficiency of his
peasantry in archery. What the most energetic of the
Stuart kings set his mind to he generally succeeded in; and
possibly, if the dagger of “that mischant traitor, Robert
Grahame,” had spared his life at Perth, James might have
done what so many Scottish kings failed to do; as it was,
we see signs of improvement among his people.</p>

<p>The bodyguard that the author of the “King’s Quhair”
embodied for himself was the origin of the famous “Royal
Company of Archers” that still flourishes vigorously in
Edinburgh. So say the present “Bodyguard for Scotland,”
though their oldest extant records stop short two centuries
and a half of King James’s time.</p>

<p>With James’s assassination at Perth, the new-born zeal
for archery seems to have died away; and it is not till we
come to the time of James V. that any noteworthy traces of
its practice can be found. If we may judge from a story
told in Lindsay of Pitscottie’s quaint old chronicle of Scotland,
the Commons’ king had some fine archers in his kingdom;
for Lindsay tells us how the Scottish marksmen were
victorious in what must surely have been the earliest
friendly shooting-match between England and Scotland.
The occasion of this international match was Henry VIII.
sending an embassy with the garter to his nephew, the
young King of Scots, in 1534. “In this year,” says Pitscottie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
whose spelling we modernize, “came an English ambassador
out of England, called Lord William Howard: a
bishop and other gentlemen, to the number of three score
horse: who were all able wailled [picked] gentlemen for
all kinds of pastimes, as shooting, leaping, wrestling, running,
and casting of the stone. But they were well essayed
in all these before they went home, and that by their
own provocation, and they almost ever tint [lost]: while at
the last the king’s mother favored the Englishmen, because
she was the king of England’s sister; and therefore she took
a wager of archery upon the Englishmen’s hands, contrary
to the king her son, and any half dozen Scotsmen, either
noblemen, gentlemen, or yeomen, that so many Englishmen
should shoot against them at ‘rovers,’ ‘butts,’ or ‘prick-bonnet.’
The king hearing of this bonspiel [sporting match]
of his mother was well content. So there was laid a hundred
crowns, and a tun of wine pandit [staked] on each side.
The ground was chosen in St. Andrews. The Scottish archers
were three landed gentlemen and three yeomen, to wit:
David Wemyss of that ilk, David Arnott of that ilk, and
Mr. John Wedderburn, vicar of Dundee. The yeomen were
John Thomson in Leith, Steven Tabroner, and Alexander
Baillie, who was a piper. [The Scottish archers] shot wondrous
near, and won the wager from the Englishmen; and
thereafter went into the town, and made a banquet to the
queen and the English ambassador, with the whole two hundred
crowns and the two tuns of wine.”</p>

<p>Archery from this time became an established pastime in
Scotland, amicably sharing men’s leisure with its old enemies
golf and football, while with the ladies it took rank as
their chief, if not only, outdoor pastime. Queen Margaret
herself might possibly have taken her place with
credit beside the six Englishmen she backed in this match
against her son; for we are told by Leland and others that
Henry’s sister was no mean shot, while her unfortunate
grandchild, Mary Queen of Scots, was as fond of archery as
was her cousin Elizabeth of England and many another
lady of that time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carlyle wrote in 1843: “Pickwick, Bulwer Lytton
and Alfred Tennyson—the last is the greatest genius, though
the vulgar public have not as yet recognized him as such.
He is a very handsome man, and a noble-hearted one, with
something of the gipsy in his appearance which, for me, is
perfectly charming. One night at private theatricals in being
escorted through a long dim passage to a private box, I
came on a tall man leant to the wall, with his head touching
the ceiling, to all appearance asleep, or resolutely trying
it under most unfavorable circumstances. ‘Alfred Tennyson!’
I exclaimed in joyful surprise. ‘Well,’ said he,
taking the hand I held out to him, and forgetting to let it go
again. ‘I did not know you were in town,’ said I. ‘I
should like to know who you are,’ said he; ‘I know that I
know you, but I can not tell your name.’ And I had actually
to name myself to him. Then he woke up in good earnest,
and said he had been meaning to come to Chelsea.
‘But Carlyle is in Scotland,’ I told him with due humility.
‘So I heard from Spedding already, but I asked Spedding,
would he go with me to see Mrs. Carlyle? and he said he
would.’ Last Sunday I was lying on the sofa, headachey,
when a cab drove up. Mr. Strachey? No. Alfred Tennyson
alone! Actually, by a superhuman effort of volition
he had put himself into a cab, nay, brought himself away
from a dinner party, and was there to smoke and talk with
me!—by myself—me!”</p>

<h2><a name="GEOGRAPHICAL_DISTRIBUTION_OF" id="GEOGRAPHICAL_DISTRIBUTION_OF">GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF
ANIMALS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />
<p class="center">By ALFRED NEWTON.</p>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Some facts as to the geographical distribution—whether
of plants or animals—have, it is true, been long known, indeed
they present themselves on the slightest inquiry. Every
one is aware that elephants and tigers do not roam in
our woods now-a-days, whatever may have been the case
aforetime. Many persons have read that horses were unknown
in the New World at the time of its discovery by
Europeans, and were subsequently introduced by its Spanish
conquerors. Some may even know that humming-birds
are not to be found in the Old World, and that (as has been
already said) the so-called “marsupial” animals are at the
present time, with a few exceptions, confined to Australia,
as well as that in that country nothing like vultures or woodpeckers
are to be found.</p>

<p>The assemblage of animals which inhabit any portion of
the earth’s surface, whether it be land or water, is called its
“fauna,” in the same way that the plants of a country are
called its “flora.” To be entitled to the former term it is
unnecessary that the animals composing the assemblage
should not be found anywhere else; it is enough that they
occur there and impress upon the district, be it large or
small, certain more or less well-marked peculiarities. Nor
does it follow because certain kinds of animals are found to
inhabit two districts that these two have the same fauna.
We have to take the whole assemblage as a whole, and
abide by the verdict which the majority of kinds affords us.
Now by collecting such facts as those stated in the preceding
paragraph, and such facts can be collected by the hundred
or the thousand, we are able to get hold of a general
idea of the geographical distribution of animals, and when
the results of all the knowledge on this subject which we
can acquire are brought together, it will appear that the
earth may be partitioned into several great zoölogical regions—each
separable in subregions, provinces, subprovinces
and so on.</p>

<p>America is divided into two regions—the “Nearctic” and
the “Neotropical,” which meet in Mexico at about the 22d
parallel of north latitude:—</p>

<p>(1) The Nearctic Region (that is the Northern part of the
New World) includes the Aleutian Islands, besides Greenland
and the Bermudas with all of what is generally called
North America.</p>

<p>(2) The Neotropical Region (that is the tropical part of the
New World) comprises the West India Islands, the Galapagos,
and the whole of South and Central America.</p>

<p>Passing to the Old World, it is separable, as may be seen,
into four regions.</p>

<p>(3) The Palæarctic Region (or Northern part of the Old
World) including that portion of Africa which lies to the
northward of the Great Desert, the Atlantic Islands (Madeiras,
Canaries, and Azores), the whole of Europe from
Iceland to Greece, besides Asia Minor, Palestine, Persia,
probably Afghanistan, the whole of Northern, Central and
Eastern Asia, lying to the northward of the Himalaya
Mountains and of China proper, as well as Japan.</p>

<p>(4) The Ethiopian Region consists of Africa, excepting
Morocco and Algeria (which, as already stated, belong to
the preceding region), as well as of Arabia and of course the
adjacent islands from those off the Cape Verd to Madagascar
and Socotra.</p>

<p>(5) The Indian Region includes possibly Beloochistan,
all British India, Burmah, China proper (that is, without
Chinese Tartary), Cochin China, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra,
Java, Bali, Borneo, and the Philippine Islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span></p>

<p>(6) The Australian Region is very trenchantly divided
from the Indian at the Straits of Macassar, and, beginning
with the islands of Celebes and Lombok, comprises all the
groups between them and Papua or New Guinea, as well as
Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and, generally, all the
islands of the Pacific Ocean, except those already otherwise
appropriated—as Japan, the Aleutian Islands and the Galapagos.</p>

<p>It may be added that though the preceding outlines of
geographical distribution were first laid down with reference
to the most vagrant class of animals in creation—namely
birds—their truth has since been in the main confirmed
by nearly all those zoölogists who have studied the
subject in reference to particular classes in the knowledge
of which they themselves stand preëminent.</p>

<p>Yet it may not be unreasonably expected of these six zoögeographical
regions, that they are not all equally distinct,
and it is quite possible that future researches may show that
their boundaries require some rectification.</p>

<p>The study of the geographical distribution of animals furnishes
us with facts of much importance in the history of
the earth. For example: It has been stated, and that on
the very best authority, that the marine faunas of the two
coasts of the Isthmus of Panama, which joins the two continents
of North and South America, have but thirty per
cent. of species in common. Now what does this show? No
doubt the very considerable antiquity of the barrier which
exists between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans—for if,
in anything like recent times, there had been a break in
this barrier, within the tropics where the sea is warm, then
assuredly we should have had a very much larger interchange
of the species which inhabit its two sides, or perhaps
we should even find precisely the same fishes, the same
shells, the same crabs and the same corals in the harbor of
Colon on the one side and that of Panama on the other.
As it is we have corals on the Atlantic coast of the isthmus
and on the Pacific none whatever, while, as before said, of
the rest of the marine fauna (the fishes especially) not more
than thirty per cent. are common to both. It is moreover
particularly to be noted that there seems to be no other reason
than the one here assigned for this difference. Very
many sorts of fishes and of shells which occur on one side
so much resemble those found on the other that the distinction
between them is only such as can be recognized by expert
zoölogists, yet this distinction is constantly to be observed—they
form what are called “Representative Species,”
that is, one kind of fish or shell on one side is exactly
represented by another kind of fish or shell on the other.</p>

<p>But this difference between the marine faunas of the two
coasts of the Isthmus of Panama not only proves its long
duration as a barrier of dry land, but some other deductions
follow naturally enough. It is also tolerably clear that the
Gulf Stream must have been running pretty much the same
course that it runs now so long as the barrier presented by
the Isthmus of Panama has existed. If it were not for that
barrier the current would have continued its westerly flow
onward to the Pacific Ocean. Now we have seen that the
difference between the marine faunas of the two sides of the
isthmus proves its long duration. Hence we may fairly
conclude that for so long has the Gulf stream been flowing
and helping to soften what would otherwise have been the
rigorous climate of Ireland and Scotland, thereby materially
affecting their fauna.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the old legend of St. Patrick, and how
he is said to have banished all noxious reptiles from his favorite
island. As a matter of fact only one kind of reptile
proper is found in Ireland. This is the viviparous lizard, a
harmless little animal which also occurs in Great Britain
and generally throughout the continent of Europe. But in
England we have besides a second kind of lizard, commonly
known as the sand-lizard, and this also is spread over the
Continent, where they have in addition, even in Northern
France, a third kind, the green lizard, which does not inhabit
any part of Great Britain or much less of Ireland. It
is therefore a not very unlikely deduction from these facts
that the viviparous lizard had made its appearance in this
part of the world at an epoch when Ireland was joined to
England by dry land, and England was in like manner
connected with France, and that that epoch was earlier than
the time when the sand-lizard appeared, for if the latter had
then occurred it would in all likelihood have spread to Ireland.
But if we suppose, and geologists tell us we may
do so, St. George’s Channel to have been formed before the
English Channel was, then it is plain that a reptile extending
its range from the middle of Europe would have been
able to get into England, but not into Ireland; and this
supposition would account for the limited distribution of
the sand-lizard. While again a third reptile, like the green
lizard, coming at a subsequent period, after the straits of
Dover were formed, would find them before him and be unable
to set his foot off the continent.</p>

<p>Thus in whatever way we regard them, the not unreasonable
deductions afforded by the facts which a study of the
geographical distribution of animals makes known to us are
of very great importance. We may of course be wrong in
some of our inferences, we very likely shall err, as some of
our predecessors have done, but the facts remain whatever
construction we put upon them, and, as they go on accumulating,
we may be sure that errors by degrees will be
swept away, and perhaps the genius of man by this means
alone may explain one of the mysteries of creation.</p>

“I have met with many discouragements
since my connection with the C.
L. S. C., sickness and pressure of business
leaving me barely time to accomplish
the work, which I am sure is very
poorly done—quite different from what
I supposed at the beginning. I have
studied alone, with only such help as
the books of the course and a few old
school books have afforded—with no

over with, and help me fix the events
in my memory. I have only one satisfaction:
of doing my best under the

<p>A member of the Circle suggests that local circles should
occasionally hold an evening of song, making use of the
“Chautauqua Songs” which have been sent to all members.
By doing this in advance of the several Assembly meetings
the coming season, they would be prepared to enjoy a general
service of song on the C. L. S. C. days.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A lady holding a lucrative position in a Boston printing
room writes: “All that the C. L. S. C. has done for me it
is impossible to tell. It has helped me to become better
acquainted with my Maker and his wonderful works; the
history of nations and individuals; created a greater love
for solid, instructive reading; better fitted me for teaching
in the Sunday-school, and opened avenues for thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
study, and usefulness which, I trust, will make life more
successful and useful.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>“Will you please advise me through the columns of <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span> what book to procure to learn at home how
to speak and write the English language grammatically?”
An excellent practical teacher gives the following answer to
the above question: “There is no book warranted to turn
out good writers and speakers of the English Language. If
the person desiring the information is a foreigner—a Frenchman
or a German—we could better answer the question. If
he is English, with what knowledge does he begin? If
with little knowledge, he should use some elementary book,
such as Swinton’s ‘Language Lessons,’ or better, Whitney’s
‘How to Speak and Write Correctly.’ If somewhat advanced,
some one standard text-book of the English language,
some grammar like Brown’s, would be helpful. But
better would be the advice to read some masters of English.
Read carefully and critically, and try to reproduce such essays
as Irving’s, Hawthorne’s, and Longfellow’s. Johnson
said, ‘Give days and nights to the study of Addison if you
would attain a style familiar but not coarse, elegant but
not ostentatious.’ Bunyan is said to have become master
of English from the study of the Bible.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />
<p>On Friday evening, April 28, occurred the memorial exercises
of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, in
honor of Shakspere, Bryant, Milton, Addison and Longfellow.
We have about twenty-five members in our circle,
and a limited number of invitations to persons not members
were issued, the greater part of whom attended.</p>

<p>The ladies labored hard all day in arranging the rooms,
and, as if by magic, changed the appearance from a prayer-meeting
room to one of the cosiest and most inviting places
you have ever seen. The floors were handsomely carpeted,
the walls hung with paintings, and the chairs and round
tables grouped about the room in such manner as to give
an air of informality that was truly delightful.</p>

<p>The program, as might be expected, was a choice one.
Careful preparation, a familiarity with the subject, deep interest
in the work, can be truthfully said of the efforts of
each, and to write a detailed criticism would be supererogation.
It is necessary to state, however, that in responding
to the roll-call each member gave a quotation from one

<p>Then followed exercises in which the guests were invited

<h3>THE TOASTS.</h3>

<p>“The Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle.” Response by
B. S. Dartt, our first president. “Our Memorial Authors” (Shakspere,
Longfellow, Milton, Addison and Bryant)—Rev. Alexander
McGowan. “The Chautauqua Work and its Workers Elsewhere”—Rev.
A. S. Morrison. “Higher Culture, Viewed from the Social
Standpoint”—George A. Guernsey.</p></div>

<p>Rev. S. P. Gates then spoke on the harmony of science
and religion, asserting that there is no gulf that separates
religion and science, nor any conflict where they stand together.</p>

<p>The chairman then announced that the balance of the
evening would be given to social enjoyment, soon after
which the members and guests dispersed.</p>

<h2><a name="C_L_S_C_REUNION_AT_CINCINNATI" id="C_L_S_C_REUNION_AT_CINCINNATI">C. L. S. C. REUNION AT CINCINNATI.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>One of the most delightful of evenings was spent by about
two hundred of the C. L. S. C.’s of Cincinnati and vicinity,
on Tuesday evening, May 8. The occasion bringing so many
of the members together in gala attire was their fourth annual
reunion. On the chancel railing were large and beautiful
bouquets of fragrant flowers, and the motto, “Never be
Discouraged,” hung in graceful curves across the front of
the room.</p>

<p>But the event of the evening was the unexpected visit
from Dr. Vincent, who came to see the members of the
circle, while passing through the city from the South en
route to New York.</p>

<p>When Dr. Vincent appeared on the platform a vigorous
Chautauqua salute and expressions of admiration and surprise
showed the high esteem and regard in which the
Cincinnati circles hold Chautauqua’s chief.</p>

<p>He congratulated the circle upon its good work in
the past, and encouraged those present to redouble their efforts
for the future. He said he had been traveling for some
time, had just left Louisville in the afternoon, and had
arrived in Cincinnati only a short time before, and added:
“I am really too weary to talk, for I have delivered ten addresses
in six days, and am worn out, but the sight of this
prosperous association revives me sufficiently to at least
leave a suggestion for your reflection after I am gone. One
thing I wish to impress upon your minds is the importance
of giving expression to your thoughts, either by talking or
writing.”</p>

<p>“Americans are great talkers—always making speeches.
But is it to any purpose or improvement? Is it not full of
verbiage, and too often frivolous? Usually when reunions
of ladies take place, does not their conversation drift to
commonplace subjects, and do they say anything beneficial
or worth remembering or generally proceed much further
than the weather and the fashions. But the C. L. S.
C.’s propose remedying this, and are succeeding admirably,
and when they can not suggest an ennobling topic
they keep silent.”</p>

<p>He then told them of some of the treasures Chautauqua
had in store for its visitors of ’83, and closed his address
wishing the Cincinnati circles every prosperity, and invoking
a blessing full of earnestness and affection.</p>

<p>The following is the program of the evening:</p>

<p>It was uniformly well rendered, each of the participants
being a representative of some one of the local circles.
While refreshments were being served the ’82’s held one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
their stated meetings, and decided to give a reception to
the members of ’83 of Cincinnati and vicinity in September,
during the time of the Cincinnati exposition, when the
members from a distance will have a favorable time to come
and meet other members of the Alumni Association. The
’82’s were distinguished by their badges, and though their
meeting was not large in numbers, it was very enthusiastic,
ten of those present having passed through the bronze gateway
and under the arches on Commencement Day, last August;
and many pleasant memories were revived of their
class work and Chautauqua.</p>

<p>At the close of their meeting they disbanded and mingled
with their friends in the other classes, and all partook of the
refreshments which were dispensed most bountifully.</p>

<h2><a name="TWO_GERMAN_CIRCLES" id="TWO_GERMAN_CIRCLES">TWO GERMAN CIRCLES.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>In connection with our Chautauqua Circle here, Corning,
N. Y., we have two German classes in a flourishing condition;
both classes were organized and are now being instructed
by Miss S. K. Payne, one of the Chautauqua (1882)
graduates. The classes in reality form one of Prof. Worman’s
German Circles, and are in a measure under his direction,
but Miss Payne is our leader, and she fills that position
with gratifying success. She leads us not only in our
efforts to acquire the language, but she devises so many
little plans calculated to stimulate the endeavors of her
scholars and invest the meetings with more than usual interest.
We meet once a week at her home for recitation
and German conversation, and much of the dry, hard rind
of the German grammar is smoothed away by the pleasant
nature of our meetings. We intersperse our work occasionally
with delightful little entertainments at which nothing
but German speech or German songs are tolerated. Quite
recently we had a German picnic or tea-party, and still more
recently we celebrated the Emperor William’s birthday,
not because we were particularly fond of the Emperor William,
but because he furnished such a purely German topic.
We were favored with a German speech from our teacher,
we had German recitations and essays, German songs and
German toasts, and when we adjourned to the dining-room,
we were invited to a repast not so strictly German, but one
which the German king himself might have relished. The
entertainment which these little tea-parties afford is as instructive
as it is amusing, and if other German circles have
not already inaugurated similar affairs, we advise them to
take steps in this direction at once. Such occasions promote
new ideas, teach new words, and give one confidence
to express his or her thoughts in German. We subjoin the
program of our last entertainment:</p>

<p><b>Maine (Lewiston).</b>—The Scott C. L. S. C. was organized
last October, under the leadership of Rev. W. S. McIntire,
for whom we named our circle. We number twelve. We
have taken the course as prescribed in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.
We had the benefit of a course of lectures on astronomy this
winter, made most interesting by the beautiful views shown
us, especially some of the sun spots, which were remarkably
fine. One evening our circle visited the observatory at
Bates College. There, by the use of the telescope we explored
the heavens. We saw the craters on the moon, the
belts of Jupiter and his beautiful satellites, and faint stars
or nebulæ changed into double or multiple stars of great
size and brilliancy. We observed Shakspere’s Day in the
usual manner. During the study of “Evangeline” we are
beginning our meetings with quotations from Longfellow.
The C. L S. C. idea having once taken possession of a person,
keeps him spellbound until he finishes the course, and
then will not let him go, but draws him into more and more
interesting studies, until he would fain spend his life under
its beneficent influence.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (Plymouth).</b>—A local circle, called the Pilgrim
Rock Circle, was organized here last October, with a
membership of ten; we now number thirty. Our meetings,
which are fortnightly, are instructive and interesting. We
have had one lecture, and an entertainment on the night of
Shakspere’s day.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (Boston).</b>—A Chautauqua Circle has been
formed by some of the young men of the Warren street M.
E. Church. There are thirteen members at present. We
have only taken up a part of the studies this winter, but intend
to unite with the Central Circle at Chautauqua next
fall, and take all the studies of the C. L. S. C. course. We
have named our circle the “Highland Inner Circle of the
Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle,” and mean to
take advantage of this excellent opportunity for improving
our minds.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (Rockland).</b>—We organized a Local Circle
last October; have a president, secretary, and committee
of three to arrange programs for our meetings which are
held twice a month at the homes of members. We have
Chautauqua games, readings from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
and usually recite fifty of the questions. We have also had
many abstracts on characters in Greek history, and on the
lines and houses of English history. We have kept memorial
days, had sketches of their characters, and carefully
prepared readings from Longfellow and Shakspere on their
memorial days.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (Cambridgeport).</b>—Our circle was organized
last October, with thirteen members, four gentlemen and
nine ladies. We meet on the fourth Wednesday of the
month, at the houses of the various members. All have
been greatly interested and instructed with the studies of
the past year, and most of us have been particularly interested
in astronomy. A short time since we spent an evening
in practical work with the telescope; we had a good
glass, the night was bright and clear, and we were able to
get fine views of the Moon, Saturn, Neptune, the nebulæ in
Orion, the Bee Hive, and several double stars. I suppose
this to be the proper place to make suggestions as to improvements
in our circle. One difficulty that we find is the
fact that we have no means of knowing who in our community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
are members of the C. L. S. C. unless they come forward
and make themselves known. Our local circle has
been looking this matter up, and we find quite a number of
members not connected with any local circle, and so unknown
to the other members in the city. If every member
would connect himself with a local circle, or at least give
his name to a circle, would it not serve to bind us together
more closely?</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Massachusetts (Newbury).</b>—We have a local circle of forty
members, twenty of whom do the whole or a part of the
reading. Charles J. Rolfe, an earnest member of the class
of 1884, did much to interest the community in the C. L. S.
C. course. Our first meeting was held on the 7th of October;
Mr. Rolfe was unanimously chosen president. Besides
the regular studies we try to make the meetings entertaining
by means of music, reading, spelling matches, etc.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Connecticut (Thompsonville).</b>—The Thompsonville C. L. S.
C. was organized in October last under the direction of Rev.
F. S. Barnum, and started with fifteen members. The original
members have continued zealous students, and nearly
every meeting witnessed accessions until the number has
reached more than forty, all of whom testify to the great
value as well as interest to them of the winter’s work. A
“public” was held at the close of the first two months’
studies, and also a second “public” at the end of studies for
January. Essays and addresses made up delightful evenings
for the audiences assembled. On the second occasion
astronomy alone was the subject, and topics were assigned
to ten members of the circle. The ladies read essays, and
the gentlemen delivered brief lectures illustrated by diagrams,
essays and addresses confined to six minutes. Instrumental
and vocal music increased the pleasure of the
exercises. Nine members of the local circle have joined
the main circle, and others propose to do so. The next
year a much larger number propose uniting in the work.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>New York (Springville).</b>—The circle in this place was organized
in January, 1883, and consists of fifteen members.
Our officers are a president and a secretary. We hold our
meetings once in two weeks, occasionally oftener, at the
homes of the members. We have no regular plan for conducting
the meetings, but decide at each meeting the reading
to be done before the next, and then we try to review as
nearly as possible the work that has been done. Our president
also prepares questions on the subjects we are studying,
and a portion of each evening is very profitably spent
with the questions. We have spent much more than the
appointed time on astronomy, but have enjoyed the study
so much that we did not wish to lay it aside. We have observed
several of the memorial days. We realize more and
more the value of the local circle, and find that we take
much more interest in the reading than would be possible
if each were reading alone.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>New York (Naples).</b>—A small circle of six ladies, in the
above named place, commenced the course of study last October.
We have held meetings every week; each one takes
a subject and questions upon it, making us all teachers and
all pupils. We have been through “Greek History,” “English
History,” and “Astronomy” <i>twice</i>; also took an extra,
“Smith’s Illustrated Astronomy,” which we are thoroughly
memorizing. The father of one of our circle having made
astronomy a life study, has kindly given us much valuable
aid. We hope to have many more in our circle another year,
feeling the profit and happiness we have obtained has been
great.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>New Jersey (Jersey City).</b>—Through the efforts of Rev. A.
P. Foster, pastor of the First Congregational Church, a circle
was organized here last December. The meetings of the
circle were held every alternate Tuesday, and were varied
to harmonize with the prescribed course of study. Altogether
the winter has been made profitable to all concerned,
and we hope to make our future meetings still more so.
We now number thirty and expect another year to increase
materially.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Pennsylvania (New Alexandria).</b>—About the last of November
our local circle began its meetings. Although so far
behind in our studies, by doing double work we were ready
on the first of February to begin the regular course for the
month. Our circle is composed of six members, and we
were quite pleased to see that Dr. Vincent thinks that is the
best number for a local circle. We meet once every two
weeks, and our plan is for one of the members to ask the
questions published in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, and others to
ask questions they have previously prepared on the other
branches of study. We read the “Sunday Readings” together.
We are greatly interested in this great intellectual
movement, and believe that while its present magnitude is
very wonderful, the results in the future will be even more
so.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>District of Columbia (Washington).</b>—Another local circle
has been formed in this city, called the “Ideal Circle.” We
have eight members in all, and meet once in two weeks, at
the houses of the members. We did not commence the
course until March, so we have been busily engaged in “reading
up,” and have devoted all the time at our meetings to a
review of the matter gone over. Our president conducts the
review. We hope to begin the next year’s work with all
good Chautauquans at the proper time, and so to have opportunity
to engage in wider reading and greater research
in the subjects furnished by the C. L. S. C. We are enjoying
the course, and find it very profitable to know just what
to read when we have but a few minutes to spend in reading,
and so improve instead of waste the odd moments.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>West Virginia (Charleston).</b>—Last September the Charleston
local circle was organized with a membership of nine,
which soon increased to twenty-five, among whom we number
two D.D.’s, the president of the school board, superintendent
of city schools, professional men, etc., and a full
quota of interesting ladies. Commencing late, we did not
get under good headway for several weeks, when we followed
the course as laid down in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. At first
the program was filled by volunteers, but the necessity of
more system was so apparent that we divided ourselves into
four classes, each one in its turn providing the entertainment
for the evening, thus giving to each class the program
once in four weeks. The Chautauqua course has been a
source of much pleasure and profit to its members here.
Though belonging to the class known locally as literary people,
the readings of our circle heretofore had been desultory
and unprofitable. Now we have a systematic course of good
reading, and feel obligated by a sense of pleasure and duty
to do the work we have undertaken. At the future capital
of West Virginia ours is the only literary organization. May
the C. L. S. C. increase and multiply as the fishes of the
Kanawha!</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Alabama (Eufaula).</b>—The Eufaula local circle was organized
September 7, 1882, and now numbers twenty-seven
members. Meetings are held on the first Monday night in
each month at the homes of different members, and officers
are elected quarterly. It is the first year’s reading in the
C. L. S. C. course for all the members except one. Preparatory
to our reading “Evangeline” in May, we had a
“Longfellow” program at our last meeting, May 7. Of that
meeting the <i>Daily Times</i> says: “The Eufaula local circle
of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle is in a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
flourishing condition. The most interesting and successful
meeting that has yet been had was held at Mayor Comer’s
on Monday night. An excellent program was carried out
and was a pleasant departure from the usual exercises. The
members of the circle were quite enthusiastic yesterday; a
good sign. A community takes a long step forward when
it organizes such a club as this, and we are glad that the
Eufaula branch of that greatest of all universities, ‘The
Chautauqua University,’ is growing in strength and interest.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Ohio (Ravenna).</b>—Because we have been silent all the year
is no sign that Ravenna does not possess a C. L. S. C. Long
ago the grand “Chautauqua Idea” struck us, and our pleasant
town already boasts a number of graduates of the class
of ’82. Ravenna has four circles, the Methodist C. L. S. C.
being organized late in November, 1882, with six members,
this number rapidly increasing, and now we have a flourishing
circle of eighteen regular members, with six locals.
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> is the valuable organ of our society,
and the many choice gems of reading form a very important
part of our program. Besides the regular work, we celebrate
all memorial days, Milton’s Day having been observed
with select readings, music and biographical sketch. Besides
the social enjoyments of these occasions, we derive
very much benefit intellectually, and always welcome a
memorial day. One remarkably pleasant instance this season
was the lecture given here by Rev. J. H. Vincent, upon
“That Boy.” After the lecture, upon the very kind invitation
of Judge Reed, a brilliant reception was given at his
spacious residence, and all Chautauquans were heartily
welcomed. To hear the encouraging words of Dr. Vincent
and feel the friendly grasp of his hand, gave a new impetus
to our work, and to be a Chautauquan had a more powerful
significance. Long may the C. L. S. C. flourish.</p>

<p><b>Ohio (Bethel).</b>—There are ten in our circle, of whom seven
are regular and three local members. Our meetings are
held semi-monthly, at the homes of the members. The program
consists in reviews, general questions, and half the
questions in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. We are not only interested
in the reading, but delighted with it. We find that it
just meets our wants, and we are thankful that the means
of culture are thus placed within our reach.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Indiana (Orland).</b>—Our circle was organized in the fall of
1880. Some members have moved out, and others have been
added, so the membership continues about the same—ten—all
women, and none are behind in this year’s reading. We
meet in the afternoon every week, and have a session of
three hours. We make our meetings conversational, each
member being expected to ask a question on each paragraph
of the lesson under consideration. Number one asks a question,
and any in the class who have anything bearing on the
subject have liberty to speak of it. Then number two asks
<i>her</i> question, providing it has not been asked before, and so
on around the class. At the close of each month we have
had a special day for review of the month’s work. We had
the geological charts, and enjoyed them very much, but our
time was limited, so we expect to take it up again during
the summer vacation. We have all enjoyed the English
history, while some of us know a little of Russian history;
and we are sure Dr. Vincent would be very happy could he
see the facility with which we forget the dates.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Indiana (Union City).</b>—In October last we organized a circle
of about twenty-five members. Probably more than thirty
have read the course. Our meetings have generally been at
the homes of the members and very pleasant times have we
had. Rarely has the attendance fallen below fifteen, and
often it has exceeded thirty. Besides the exercises usual to
such occasions, we purchased three “Geological Charts”
and also had the use for several evenings of an excellent
telescope which, though small, enabled us to see distinctly
the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn, etc. It is
agreed by all that the scheme is not only a grand success,
but a godsend to those who are glad to read, yet need to
have their reading directed. We hope, another year, not
only to retain our present membership, but also to enlarge
it greatly.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Illinois (Peoria).</b>—The first Chautauqua circle in Peoria,
Illinois, was organized by the Rev. C. O. McCulloch, September
20, 1882, and is known as the “Hale Chapel Circle.” It
numbers at present eighteen regular and two local members.
A growing enthusiasm has pervaded the class, a result
largely due to the faithful, earnest spirit manifested by
its instructor. In connection with the reading, some very
excellent, carefully prepared essays have been presented by
members of the class. We will close the year’s work, glad
that we have had the privilege of taking so profitable a
course of reading.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Illinois (Farmer City).</b>—We organized a local circle last
year with a membership of seven. We now number fourteen
members, with a local circle in the country, a branch
of this, with which we anticipate much pleasure in the exchange
of visits. We appoint a class conductor for each evening.
We are now quite fairly started in the work of the
present year, and esteem it of much value to us as a means
of culture and information.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Illinois (Monticello).</b>—Our circle numbers ten. We have
determined upon doing the work thoroughly, and have so
far done a great deal of reference work, particularly in the
Greek history. We meet Thursday evening of each week,
and have regular class exercise, usually conducted by the
president.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Illinois (Astoria).</b>—Our local circle is small in numbers,
there being only a dozen of us, but we are not lacking in
enthusiasm. We organized late last fall and began two
months behind time, but have almost made up the lost time.
The oldest member of our circle is nearly an octogenarian.
We have a variety of methods for conducting our meetings—nothing
stereotyped. Recently one program was somewhat
as follows: Each member responded at roll-call with
a brief poem (selected) on the stars; seventy-five questions
were asked on “Preparatory Greek Course,” and twenty-five
on “Astronomy;” a paper was read on “Plato and his Philosophy,”
and last came a “pronouncing contest;” fifty
words having been selected by the leader, they were lettered
and given to the members in turn to be pronounced. We
have a “Chautauqua missionary,” in the shape of Pansy’s
“Hall in the Grove,” which we are sending into different
homes to awaken enthusiasm, and the result is likely to be
a doubling of our numbers next year.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Wisconsin (Whitewater).</b>—We organized our club in October,
1882, shortly after a visit from Rev. A. H. Gillet. We
now number twenty-one members, and hold our meetings
once in two weeks. A program committee assigns parts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
different members, and each topic for study is presented
either by means of questions or a paper. We are enjoying
the work very much, and feel that we are greatly benefited
by it.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Wisconsin (Mauston).</b>—The Delphian class of the C. L. S.
C. was organized last January with a membership of thirteen,
but the number has since increased to twenty. Shakspere’s
day was pleasantly observed by the class. The program
consisted of readings, recitations, vocal and instrumental
music. The guests, numbering about forty, seemed
well pleased with our efforts.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Wisconsin (Milwaukee).</b>—Our circle is the fourth formed
in Milwaukee, hence, named “Delta Circle.” We have ten
regular and several local members. We meet once a week
at the house of one of the members, so that ours is a “parlor”
circle. We generally have a leader appointed two
weeks ahead, who takes charge of the literary exercises of the
evening, topics for special study being generally given out
by the leader a week ahead. Questions and informal discussion
form a large part of our exercises, and we find our
circle to be an inspiration to higher work, and a great mutual
help.</p>

<p>The following notice of the celebration of Shakspere’s
birthday by this circle is taken from a Milwaukee paper:
“The recent gathering at 146 Fifth Street, in response to the
invitations sent out by the Delta Circle, C. L. S. C., was a
very unique and pleasing affair. The company met to celebrate
the 319th anniversary of the birth of William Shakspere.
The parlors were appropriately and tastefully decorated
with evergreen flowers and smilax. Upon a banner
over the large bust of Shakspere was seen “1564-1883.”
Each of the fifty persons present was provided with a program
printed on satin, the Chautauquan badge, a green leaf
and the symbols representative of the society’s name, being
hand-painted. The literary exercises consisted of roll-call,
to which the members responded with quotations from
Shakspere, readings, recitations, and a discussion upon the
question, ‘Did Bacon write Shakspere?’ The debaters
were very persuasive. The lady on the affirmative, at the
close of her argument, veiled Shakspere, and at the close of
the negative, the veil, touched by an unseen hand, fell, and
Shakspere stood vindicated. The music was very fine, being
Shaksperean in character. After the literary program,
the company partaking of refreshments, was made merry
by the passing of a handsomely decorated birthday cake,
containing a small coin, which the happy finder was to invest
in Shaksperean literature. The guests departed, wishing
many happy returns of the day of immortal Shakspere.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Michigan (Lisbon).</b>—This is our first year. We commenced
with seven members. Our books did not reach us
until late, but by increased labor we caught up by the first
of January. We now hope to finish the year’s work according
to the plan marked out in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. We
have one member who lives six miles away, and who rarely
fails to meet us at the monthly meetings. Two worthy
M.D.’s, who have little time to spare, have taken up the
course, and are very enthusiastic. The one the class most
“delighteth to honor” is a lady who has nearly rounded her
sixty years. She is our questioner. We trust that our
Heavenly Father may spare her these many years, that she
may be able to finish the course, and to enjoy the fruits of
her labor. Another of our members is a mother with poor
health. She receives the Chautauqua Idea as a godsend to
help her keep pace with the five active, restless minds that
are beginning to pour their questions in upon her. It has
been a year of profit to each one, and one that we have all
enjoyed.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Iowa (Council Bluffs).</b>—The circle is well attended, and has
many animated seekers after true culture, and more spirit is
manifested in its meetings now than when we first started.
We meet every Monday evening, at the pastor’s home. One
of our professors here gave a brilliant lecture recently on the
subject of “Astronomy,” and Hon. W. J. Armstrong, another
eloquent orator, was secured to speak on “London Society.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Iowa (Clinton).</b>—The Clinton branch of the C. L. S. C. was
organized October 16, 1882, with a membership of twenty-five,
three being graduates of 1882. Our circle meets every
alternate Monday evening, at the homes of members. Our
president, Rev. S. H. Weller, D.D., of the Presbyterian
Church, conducts the meetings in a very interesting manner.
Papers on the lesson have been prepared and read by different
members, occupying the time for about half an hour,
and followed by a general talk on the same subject. One
evening while studying geology all were requested to bring
in at the next meeting geological specimens, and tell what
they could about them. Several evenings each brought two
or three questions on the lesson written on slips of paper,
which, after being shook up in a hat, were drawn and answered
by the members. The plan we enjoy most is to pass
round the circle, each member in turn stating a fact concerning
the lesson, until all the principal points are brought
out, this being followed by a “round-table talk.” During
the first week in April, while we were still studying astronomy,
an excursion party, in charge of Dr. Weller, went to
Chicago for the purpose of studying the stars by the aid of
the large telescope at the observatory there.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Iowa (Panora).</b>—We organized a circle last October with a
membership of eleven. We meet every Monday evening,
review the lesson as outlined, or in other words talk over
the work, every member expressing his views, asking questions,
etc. At our last meeting Mrs. Haden treated the
circle to lemonade made from lemons grown in her home by
the fireside. The discussion that evening was “Lemon
Culture in Iowa.”</p>

<p><b>Iowa (Manchester).</b>—In this modest county seat of less
than three thousand people, there is the largest C. L. S. Circle
in Iowa. There were seven graduates last summer from
here. Some of these are prosecuting the White Seal Course.
All of them have been active in one of the three local circles
which together number in all some forty-eight, besides a
history class which is composed of young people, and is an
outgrowth of the C. L. S. C., and the Young People’s Lyceum
of the M. E. Church, which may be said to have received
its inspiration from the same. We meet in three
different classes and all come together on “Memorial Days.”
We have tried various plans, but we find a good leader who
has the tact to draw the different members out in a conversational
style is the most satisfactory and beneficial, and as
we have two or three in our class who are happily possessed
of this tact, we utilize it to the fullest extent, always to our
profit and pleasure.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Missouri (Kansas City).</b>—We have just celebrated Shakspere’s
birthday. Kind friends of the circle gave us the benefit
of their excellent musical talent, “and all went merry
as a marriage bell.” We can not measure the benefit we
already have derived from our connection with the “People’s
College.” Next year we think our membership will
be doubled, making it over one hundred. The possibilities
for good that lie within the compass of the C. L. S. C. seem
infinite.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Utah (Salt Lake City).</b>—Our circle was organized February
3, the present year. Rather late to take up the course with
the class of 1886, but we are working hard and hope that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
continuing our studies through the summer months we may
be ready to commence with the class next October. We
have thirteen regular members. Our meetings are held
weekly in the parlor of the M. E. church. They are quite
informal. Each member is appointed a committee of one
to bring to the circle as much of interest as possible in the
way of notes, references, bright thoughts, criticisms, etc.,
in connection with our studies.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>California (San Jose).</b>—Our little city contains about seventy-five
Chautauquans. They are divided up into several
neighborhood circles, which meet either weekly or semi-monthly.
All are in a thrifty condition, and in some there
is much enthusiasm. One is called “the University Circle,”
not because it aspires to take a full university course,
but because it is so fortunate as to have for its meeting place
the parlors of the University of the Pacific, an admirable
college under the vigorous care of President Stratton, who
is also president of our Pacific Coast C. L. S. C. This circle
has about twenty members, who have met regularly, read
all the required reading, and had the great advantage of
being often instructed by various members of the university
faculty. Two or three of the members of this circle will be
among our graduates at Monterey. All the San Jose circles
combine for a monthly meeting, and have enjoyed a series
of delightful lectures and papers which ripe scholars might
listen to with profit and pleasure. We are all now on the
<i>qui vive</i> for Monterey, and expect to have the most enthusiastic
meeting that Pacific Grove has yet seen.</p>

<h3>LECTURE BY BISHOP WARREN ON ASTRONOMY.</h3>


<p>What pleasures you have in astronomy, what a constant
delight! You are reading the poems of the old Greeks
written in the skies. They had thoughts about manhood
so broad, so heroic, so full of glorious sympathies, that there
were no books on earth fit to record them in, no marbles
enduring enough to celebrate the remarkable and interesting
deeds. So they took the page of the clear heavens, and
put one hero there, and some suffering one near by, and the
hero marching on to the deliverance of the suffering. The
poetry, the pathos, the great deeds, the special sacrifices,
all that they could think of, was written in the skies, and
they read it nightly and taught it to their children in the
open air. They read it as they sailed on the round sea.
They kept in their minds the glory and heroism of the race,
as it was there portrayed before them.</p>

<p>But the thoughts of the Greeks were mean and poor and
small, compared with the thoughts that come to the astronomer
of to-day. Then the stars were only little points in
the heavens, and now they are greater worlds than we can
think. We use them as the machinery of the gymnasium
upon which to stretch our minds and invigorate our
thought, not only in regard to material distance and greatness
and glory, and years without count, but after a little
they will become significant of the infinite power and godhead
of our father who made all these things. Paul puts it
just right, that these things that are seen tell of the eternal
power and Godhead, so that people that see these things, and
do not believe in him, are even without excuse. Then
comes the teachings of the Elder Brother and the infinite
Savior teaching something more than his power and Godhead,
even of his Fatherhood and loving care for his children.</p>

<p>Do you know the pleasure of reading these heavens, of all
the bright eyes signify, perchance, to you, in their nightly
gaze upon you? Whenever I look into the heavens above
there are friendly faces, there are bright eyes, there are, I
may almost say, individuals that I well know, that I can
not only call their names, but tell the very substances of
which they are made, and rejoice that they look down upon
me with a friendly eye. Under the oak at Hebron I hear
God’s voice saying to me, as it did to Abraham, “Lift up
thine eyes now unto the heavens.” When God wants to
make a man great enough to found a nation, to have a
special influence on the earth, he takes him out under the
open heavens. By the infinite stars Abraham got his faith
in an infinite God enlarged enough to trust him in all
things.</p>

<p>I think any one who has not known the heavens might
complain like Carlyle in his old age, “Why didn’t somebody
teach me when I was young the names of the stars and the
groupings of the constellations, which I do not half know
now, and thereby have lost pleasure for a lifetime?” You
can easily teach these things to those about you, to younger
brothers and sisters, to children committed to your care as
teachers. They will receive such teaching with delight.
First teach them the North Star and the Pointers as always
directing the gaze toward it. Tell them some stories about
the Greek mythology of Theseus. Then tell them a little
about finding some of the constellations. Teach them to
know where to look for them at various seasons of the year.
Then come to the planets. The planet that happens to be
plainest in your sky at present is Venus. Tell them how
far east it will come among the stars. You can get, in any
ordinary almanac, her greatest elongation, the date, the
time, and the star to which it goes. Tell one of these children
that this star in the sky will journey so far toward the
east, and then begin to go back among the stars toward the
west. What a thing it will be for you to have a reputation
for having the gift of prophecy, and what a thing it will be
for you and your reputation when it comes true. Then tell
them it will go west and come so close to the sun that by
and by you can scarcely see it for the glory and brightness
of the setting sun. Meanwhile, perhaps, Mercury will come
in sight, and on some favorable night, on rare occasions, you
can tell them, “There, you see that star; perhaps you will
never see it again in your lives.” Thus you will give them
acquaintance with a few stars and get them in the habit of
looking up, a blessed thing for individuals in this world to
do. They will interest father and mother about it, and
that will interest all the rest of them, and it will be an exceeding
great delight. Tell them of the few stars in the
east just before sunrise, of Jupiter in the east at present.
Tell them of the great changes that are going forward in
that planet at present. You saw an account of that in the
newspapers. But tell them that Jupiter has been so hot
and covered with clouds so long that probably we have
never seen its surface at all until a few months since, and
now that a great floating island of scoria has come up to the
surface, and it has been seen there now for nearly two
years, and when it came near the sun men were anxious to
know if the spot would be seen when it came up on the
other side of the sun. They looked for it eagerly, and when
they discovered that spot again, it had floated a long way in
longitude.</p>

<p>These stars seem to be almost alive, and the thought that
great activities are going on in them will exceedingly interest
those with whom you have to do.</p>

<p>Then, how easily you can teach your circles the idea of
distance. Just draw them in your school rooms where you
“schoolma’ams”—the most honorable name in the world except
that of mother—are permitted to teach. Draw them, and
by this means you will be able to teach these little ones a few
fundamental facts, and enlarge yourselves as you strive to
grasp these distances. Bring the idea to them how long it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
would take a locomotive to go from the earth to the sun, three
hundred and twenty years, running all the time; how long it
would take to go elsewhere. Just stretch these little ones,
for minds never give way, however much they may stretch
or enlarge, stretch them up to understand these things that
God has put before us.</p>

<p>I will represent the size of the sun by this table, and then
represent Mercury and Venus with the head of a pin; represent
the earth by a small-sized pea, very small, the smallest
that grows at the end of the pod; represent Mars with
another, and Jupiter with an orange. In an astronomy
which I first taught, and the first one I ever studied, too,
and it was studied and taught at the same time, there used
to be an illustration that I have often used with great profit.
Go out on your croquet ground, put down a two-bushel basket,
for instance, to represent the sun, then draw at suitable
distances the orbits of the different bodies. If you have
some little children about the school house, put the liveliest
little fellow you have to represent Mercury; then the liveliest
girl to represent Venus; you know who will represent
the earth; put some little fiery fighter to represent
Mars, and explain it; then you can get some least sized
brothers to represent the asteroids; some big old grandfather
that will go slowly to represent Jupiter, etc. Try to
start them. Let Mercury go his round swiftly as possible;
let Venus go with queenly dignity, and the earth more
slowly. You will get into confusion at first, and you will
have a good laugh, but you will give to those young minds
some illustration of how the earth revolves around the sun.</p>

<p>Don’t try to teach too much. Begin slowly with a single
idea. You know how these lectures were represented with
an apple swinging around the sun, sometimes with an elastic
string to represent how near the moon came down to it.
There are a thousand ways of making this interesting, plain
and profitable. As you begin to study these, you find your
own mind develops and unfolds in this direction.</p>

<p>I just looked into a book of poetry before coming up here,
and almost to my surprise on a single page I found more
than a dozen allusions to the stars. Astronomy is making
itself felt in literature, is coming to be one of the largest
means of expression. We are always lacking means of expressing
our thoughts; for our words you philologists know
have been mostly taken from material things, and then
raised up one degree to represent mental ideas. For instance,
we say “hard” of a table, then complain that it is a
“hard” thing to bear, bringing it up into the region of mind;
and we give words one more uplift for spiritual significance.
So that our language is all the time one, two or three degrees
below the full significance of that which is in our spiritual
perception. Now, astronomy with its vastness, with
its might and glory, is coming more and more into literature,
so that you want an idea of it, and want to know what
is to be understood by the words used. And especially
when you come to that highest thought, when the Infinitely
Wise condescends to speak in the language of men, and
men’s words tremble and break down and can not bear his
great thought, then you want to say, “High as the heavens
are above the earth, so high are his thoughts and ways above
ours.”</p>

<p>How much shall we grasp of his thoughts? As much as
we grasp of his symbols. He has filled the Bible all full of
his symbols, with the Divine Word full of the things of
heaven, that we may know of the greatness and glory and
power expressed in some of his great thoughts for the children
of men. And we want to rise, grasping them, more
and more of them, until “a primrose by the river’s brim, a
yellow primrose, is to” us, and something more, and the
meanest flower that blows brings thoughts that lie too deep
for tears. What shall the heavens mean when we are used
to utter God’s thought?</p>

<p>By reason of this I want you to spread the knowledge of
the heavens above you just as freely as you possibly can.
In Pennsylvania, in a quiet inland town that was supposed
to be almost dead, some one with a little enthusiasm proposed
to form a star club. It was a club for the study of the
stars, and no man was to be admitted thereto except on certain
conditions. He could be put on the course of study, he
could have his preparatory course, he could gradually come
along up, but the excellence of the real membership could
not be obtained until he passed this test, until he could go
out under the open heavens and call a hundred stars by
name. How many here are eligible? A little pains would
make it, a little pains along in the early evenings of a month,
and then along in the later evenings of a month or two; a
few minutes only would give you the ability of calling a
hundred stars by name. It makes you feel a little like God,
for “He calls all the stars by their names,” in the greatness
of his power. And it is good for me to know some of the
names that have trembled into the air from divine power
and out of divine wisdom; it is good to call over the works
of God.</p>

<p>Now, with a little enthusiasm here and there and elsewhere,
you can get individuals to know the names of the
stars very easily. I see here before me what I do not hesitate
to advertise, simply because I have not been requested
to do it, the outgrowth of one of our ideas in the “Recreations
in Astronomy.” You will remember that there are
some dark plates with bright spots, with directions to cut
them out, stick them in a box, and put them before a candle.
It is a little crude, but that thought has been taken up by
Prof. Bailey, and a lantern constructed that is the most perfect
invention in this department ever made. [Shows the
lantern.]</p>

<p>This round disk is a representation of the northern heavens.
It is an exact representation of all the stars in the
northern sky. It gives their names, makes them revolve
around the heavens, sets them to any hour or minute of the
night of any month, in the exact position that they are at
that very minute or month in the sky. Here on these other
sides are the other portions of the heavens, north and south.
It is beyond question the greatest invention in this line that
has ever been made. It has the approval of such astronomers
as Proctor, Asaph Hall, the men of distinction in the
United States, and of such names as carry weight and
authority anywhere. This is a Chautauqua invention.
(Applause.) It has done more for the study of the heavens
and the understanding of uranography than any other invention
that has been made.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>But few people in the East have a correct idea of the Red
River Valley. For hundreds of miles the land is as level as
a floor; for thirty miles on either side of the river there is
not even the roll of the prairie, and scarcely a tree or shrub
in sight. The railroads shoot from village to village as
straight as the flight of an arrow. You would see neither
grade nor cut during forty-eight hours of travel.</p>

<p>The choice lands of the valley seem to be on the west side
of the river, north from Grafton to the Dominion, and west
to the Pembina Mountains, the land growing richer as you
approach the mountains. There is but little government
land to be obtained near the railroad. Although it has been
in the market less than a year, nearly every section is
taken, and prices range, according to the locality, from $200
to $4,500 for 160 acres of entirely unimproved land. In some
counties many sections are apparently in the hands of speculators
and railroad companies, who do nothing toward
improving either roads or farms. The surpassing fertility
of the soil has given Dakota its reputation. Its richness
has never been exaggerated; it is as productive as the
valley of the Nile, and it owes its fertility to the same
cause. The annual overflow of the Red River, for centuries,
has left a deposit that is unrivaled in wheat-producing
qualities.</p>

<p>In discussing the future prosperity of the Red River Valley
all admit that the control of these floods, by some system
of levees, and drainage, is a vital question. The excess
of water not only delays seeding but sometimes the harvesting,
and it must seriously affect the healthfulness of
that section. Water can not stand till it becomes stagnant
without producing malaria. Nearly every one will tell you
how healthy the people are; yet a prominent physician admitted
that there was a great deal of fever, and that he
feared there would be more as the country became more
populous.</p>

<p>These low lands moreover send out during the hot summer
days great swarms of immense mosquitos.</p>

<p>There is no gravel with which to make roads, hence in
the spring they are something wonderful to behold; at certain
seasons they are impassable. “I have just driven five
miles,” said a gentleman, “and every foot of the way the
wagon wheels sank to the hubs. There have been no drays
in the streets of this city for three weeks. All carting has
been done with hand-carts.”</p>

<p>And yet there is no doubt that this is a country with
grand possibilities, able to support an immense population,
rich in its soil, and worth all it is costing to make it habitable.
Pioneer life is not one-half as hard here as it was in
the days when New York State was reclaimed from a wilderness;
but let no one come here thinking there is nothing
to be done but to select a quarter section of land, and in a
few months become rich. There is wealth here for those
who seek it, but they must seek it with all their hearts.</p>

<p>The most prosperous section of the country, as it appears
to a stranger, is on the line of the North Pacific road between
Fargo and Bismarck. The foot hills begin at the
James River and the grade ascends steadily until a point is
reached at least five hundred feet above the valley. From
Huron, in the south, to the Turtle Mountains, in the north,
and west to the Missouri River, are what may be called the
high-lands of Dakota, embracing as fine a rolling prairie
land as can be found in the West. There are, however, poor
sections; the soil is not so rich and deep as lower down in
the valley; yet here 14,000 bushels of oats are said to have
been raised from 180 acres, and 400 bushels of potatoes per
acre. In the north, at Fort Totten, on Devil’s Lake, small
fruits are grown in abundance, all kinds of vegetables and
an inferior kind of corn. Yet in Russia apples and cherries
are raised in abundance, three hundred miles farther
north than Winnipeg. Toward the south, between Huron
and the North Pacific Railroad, it is much warmer, and a
larger variety of crops can be raised. This whole section
has good air, is not flooded every spring, has a fair amount
of rain, and produces well under proper cultivation. As a
rule the water is poor, alkaline and brackish. At Steele, a
bright and thriving county seat, on the Northern Pacific,
half-way between Jamestown and Bismarck, soft water has
been found.</p>

<p>There are some things about the Devil’s Lake country
that seem very odd. As far as the eye can reach there is
scarcely a tree or shrub. You may ride across the prairie
for a hundred miles and not cross a stream, large or small;
the surface is a rolling prairie, and in almost every hollow
there is a pond of water; some of these ponds are half a
mile across and remain throughout the year; probably the
ground is frozen so deep that it can not absorb the water
from the melting snow. The same cause prevents the forming
of streams as the frozen hollows hold the water. A
proper system of drainage, connecting all the ponds, would
fill the country with brooks.</p>

<p>It is almost the country of the “midnight sun.” One can
see to read without lamp-light till nearly ten o’clock, and
again as early as three in the morning. It is said that in
summer the evening and morning twilight can be seen at
the same time.</p>

<p>The “shacks,” or houses, are strange dwellings for human
beings to live in; being merely a board shanty, one story
high, often only ten by twelve, with perhaps one small
window and a door, the whole cabin covered with black
tar-paper, and batten strips nailed over the cracks. Sometimes
the home is nothing but a hole dug into the side of a
hill, with a door and no window. Some of the houses, and
many of the barns, are made of sod cut and laid one upon
another, just as we lay brick; occasionally the walls are
thicker at the base than at the top, and curve in at the center
with graceful lines; in fact some of the sod houses are
very pretty, and must be quite warm. We fancied them
covered with green grass in summer, and sprinkled with
violets and blue forget-me-nots.</p>

<p>Fort Totten and the Indian Reservation are here, and the
government is experimenting with an industrial school,
trying to Christianize and educate the Indians. It is a success.
In answer to questions Major Crampton said, “You
can educate and civilize them as well as you can the whites,
but you must have patience, and begin with the children.
We have a school for girls, and the Sisters of Charity teach
them how to sew, cook, and do housework, and we teach
the boys how to farm and do general work; then when they
want to marry we give them their own home and land in
severalty, and you have no idea how happy and prosperous
they are. You couldn’t get a civilized girl to go back to the
old life, and even the heathen want civilized wives. I make
and unmake chiefs. The best men are appointed to all the
offices. Old men with two wives are permitted to live with
them, but young men are put in prison if they attempt polygamy.
We forbid immoral dances.”</p>

<p>Devil’s Lake is sixty miles long and six miles wide; there
is no outlet or inlet, and the water is brackish; it abounds
with fish. The name of the lake seems to be a misnomer,
as there are no evidences of heat in any part of the country,
not even enough for comfort. In May it was covered with
ice four feet thick. A little warmth would have done no
harm. The owners of property in that section are anxious
to make it a summer resort, and propose to give hearty assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
to any Chautauqua workers who will open a Sunday-school
assembly there.</p>

<p>There is beauty here for the artist. Over there is the
white line of the beach, with a forest background, a green
slope between. To the left are dim wreaths of smoke, curling
cloudward: they come from the “council fires” of the
Sioux braves, as they camp on the reservation; they seem
to ascend from fires lighted by invisible hands, and around
them seem to be gathered the spirits of departed warriors,
shadows, hidden from unanointed eyes. To the west the
sun is a ball of fire dropping into a sea of ice: sapphire,
flame and pearl are mixed with the blue and golden light,
and arch toward heaven, tinging forest and hill with celestial
splendor. As the orb of day sinks behind the hills, it
seems like the path to glory, and but a step—</p>

</div>

<p>Montana is entered at the Little Missouri, one hundred
miles west of Bismarck. The road to this point runs
through an upland prairie, or valley. From Bismarck to
Livingston, the gateway to the Park, a distance of six hundred
miles, the rain-fall is light, insufficient for general
farming. In the summer the grasses dry or cure, and it is
claimed they are very nutritious, and much relished by
herds. At Miles City, and Billings, canals twenty and
thirty miles long are being dug which, when completed,
will be used to irrigate the valley. This can never be a
great agricultural country without irrigation. Large crops
are not raised except on farms that have a natural overflow
from some stream or in some exceptionally wet season.
But with a water supply under control, there is no reason
why this wide, rich valley, may not supply the land with
its productions. Let none come here to engage in farming
unless they are prepared to supply their crops with abundance
of water; there are plenty of streams, or an artesian
well can be sunk, which, with an engine or wind-mill, and
force-pump, would enable any one to make a fortune. But
none need fear to come and engage in herding. Fabulous
stories are told of the fortunes made from flocks and herds.
The ranches are in the valleys, being used in the winter for
the herds, and for the horses in the summer. They are located
on the streams, and join the mountain lands in the
rear, where the herds and flocks range at large, and fatten
without even being fed or cared for.</p>

<p>Sunday is not observed as a holy day. Trains run; building
and all kinds of labor continue, and if there is any difference,
there is more bustle on the Sabbath than on any
other day. At Billings, saloons are open, hurdy-gurdies
playing, negroes singing, and drunken dances going on in
rooms on the main street of the village.</p>

<p>We visited here the Crow Reservation, and saw among
the Indians one of the finest specimens of physical manhood
in the world. A Crow warrior, with a physique that
Hercules might have envied—straight as an arrow, colored
nut-brown; with an eye like that of an eagle, and with the
bearing of a Cæsar; one could easily fancy that a second
King Philip stood before him. The Crows have a singular
burial custom: they wind, with sheets, the bodies of the
dead, practising a primitive kind of embalming, and then
place them on elevated platforms, or fasten them to the
limbs of a tree. At one of their burial places we saw the
body of their old chieftain, Blackbow. The table upon
which it lay was falling into decay, but the body remained
undisturbed. For many a year it had kept a silent watch
over the happy hunting-ground of his people.</p>

<p>Here, also, the experiment of industrial schools is being
tried. Said the Crow agent, “We are teaching them how
to work. I believe one plow is as good as two spelling-books,
with these people. We must teach them how to
labor, and the dignity of it.” It was through this valley
that Custer marched to his death, and many places are
named for him.</p>

<p>The whole surface of the country, for hundreds of miles,
is covered with petrified trees, snakes, and shells. We
saw hundreds of petrified stumps, some of them six feet
across.</p>

<p>Citadel Rocks and Pyramid Park, are on the line of the
Pacific road, and are wonderful freaks of nature. The latter
seems to have been produced by the burning of the coal
that underlies the whole country; in fact, in some places,
the fires still burning can be seen from the car windows—one
fire being near enough to be felt inside the cars.</p>

<p>All along the line antelope are feeding on the hillsides,
and in many places those natural communists, the hawk
and prairie-dog, can be seen sitting together beside their
common home.</p>

<p>The Upper Yellowstone is as lovely a valley as the eye of
man ever saw. For one hundred miles east of Livingston
the scenery is of wondrous beauty. The slopes of the hills
and the mountains turn in graceful curves, mountain
against mountain, peak above peak, valley beyond valley,
flooding the air and sky with lines of beauty. Some of the
mountains are ribbed horizontally, others from base to
peak, and all are covered with green verdure, mixed with
the brown of last year’s grasses; the fir tree dots the whole
with patches of brilliant green, and the beautiful Yellowstone
dashes through the valley. Nestled in secluded places
are the cabins; grazing on the hillsides are herds of cattle,
and here and there the reckless “cow-boy” can be seen
dashing across the plains.</p>

<p>At Billings we passed through a heavy snow storm, but
as we journeyed westward we felt the warm touch of the
Chennock, as it swept down the valley, bringing life and
beauty in its gentle touch. Every hilltop is rounded and
covered with grasses, and it does not seem possible that on
all this round globe there is another valley with such a
wealth of graceful curves and delicate colors.</p>

<p>Enthroned at the head of the valley, Livingston sits a
very queen; in her right hand the Yellowstone Park, in
her left the Bozeman Pass over the Rockies, Emigrant,
Crazy, and Baldhead mountains, seemingly but a mile away,
though in reality more than fifty, lift their hoary heads
fourteen thousand feet toward the heavens, and sparkle in
the sunlight like jewels in her crown.</p>

<p>Northern Dakota and Manitoba are very cold countries.
In the rural districts the inhabitants do not pretend to have
schools in the winter, it is so cold they would not dare to let
the children attend. Sometimes during storms men fear to
leave their stores at night, and remain in them rather than
risk their lives in going home; farmers tie a rope around
their bodies, fastening one end to their cabins, when they
go out to feed their cattle, and no one leaves home that can
avoid it.</p>

<p>But with proper preparation colonies will make no mistake
in locating in Dakota or Montana, and the same may
be said of individuals. For lack of correct information
parties are sometimes deceived. A story is told of a party
of German emigrants, who came this spring from across the
sea. They had been induced to come by some foreign
agent, who had given them a picture of Gladstone, a beautiful
little village, and had agreed to locate them there on
government lands. Instead of fulfilling his promise he
located them several miles away, where there was not a
cabin in sight. Said an eye-witness: “It was laughable
and sad to see them. Each man had a cut of Gladstone
in his hand, and they were all looking for the houses.”</p>

<p>There are rare opportunities to make fortunes; the soil
is exceedingly fertile, especially so in Dakota; the cereals
grow abundantly, even with the poor farming practiced.
Farms and city lots, properly located in thriving towns, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
steadily increasing in value, and there are plenty of government
lands yet unoccupied, in excellent localities. The
Northern Pacific Railroad has any quantity of its very best
lands, between Jamestown and Bismarck, yet unsold. One
can scarcely make a mistake in settling there, because the
land is high and not subject to inundation. There are splendid
opportunities in all the country around Bismarck and
north, even to the far-famed Turtle Mountains. In all the
above-mentioned section success is assured to the patient,
hard-working settler. He will have to endure privations;
the severe cold of an almost arctic winter; a rude cabin for
a dwelling-place; loss of opportunities for education; few
churches or Sunday-schools, and a promiscuous population.
There are many men and women of culture among the people,
but there are also a great many adventurers, as in every
new country. But in time all this will change, roads will
be worked, schools and churches will be built, cabins will
be changed into elegant farm-houses, and society will crystallize
as it has done in eastern centers. All this will come
after the struggle for existence, which is now going on, is
over.</p>

<h2><a name="COMING_CHAUTAUQUA_DAYS" id="COMING_CHAUTAUQUA_DAYS">COMING CHAUTAUQUA DAYS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Quite a scientific season will this of ’83 be, recalling the
distinguished programs when Prof. Doremus illuminated
them. Now, in addition to the graphic Prof. Edwards, who
reappears, there is to be the brilliant course of Prof. W. C.
Richards, the bare reading of which is like a <i>menu</i> to a
famished intellect. Dr. Newell, of Chicago, and Prof.
Young, of Princeton College, also lecture on scientific topics.
It is to be a revival in physics.</p>

<p>The lessons in cookery, by Miss Ewing, are a recognition
of the growing interest in higher culinary art, an accomplishment
considered by some to be the highest of all arts,
as it certainly is the most important to mankind. Chautauqua
proposes to contribute its share to make this art universal,
until it can no longer be said that the <i>chef</i> of a hotel
can command a higher salary than the president of a college.</p>

<p>And there will be Prince Bolly presiding either at hotel
or spelling-match with equal grace. General Lewis offers
the prizes for the best spellers; would it not be a fair return
for the best spellers to offer a prize for the best hotel keeper,
with the secret certainty, of course, that Mr. Lewis would
win it, and so get his reward for services in behalf of correct
orthography and good living at Chautauqua?</p>

<p>People at Chautauqua always live high—1,400 feet above
the sea. The place is pure atmospherically, aquatically,
morally, and intellectually they live in a rarified and quickening
medium. The whole effect is elevating, though we
never saw a person on the grounds who had “got high.”</p>

<p>Wallace Bruce, the man of Scotch name and lineage, but
of all-world culture, will be there and personify the <i>literati</i>
of all times and nations. To know Bruce is a liberal education
in <i>belles-lettres</i>.</p>

<p>A wit of his time proposed as an epitaph on Congreve,
the projector of the rocket (in a double sense) this wicked
sentence. “He has gone to the only place where his fireworks
can be excelled.” That place might be Chautauqua
instead of a worse place, if Congreve had lived till now.
The world of Chautauqua will be delighted with pyrotechnics
both by day and by night this year. The famous Japanese
day fireworks, which have proved such an attraction
at Manhattan Beach, Long Branch, and other resorts, will
be the sensation at Chautauqua beach. We imagine we
can hear the “ohs!” from the “windy suspirations of forced
breath” of tens of thousands of spectators.</p>

<p>The program this year fairly glitters with great names,
as, Joseph Cook, Talmage, Judge Tourgée, Hon. Will Cumback,
and the long list of D.D.’s, collegians and specialists.</p>

<p>The Teachers’ Retreat advances, not retrogrades. Read
the program; wonder and admire. The experimental
classes of Miss Read should be worth the price of the course
to any teacher.</p>

<p>Music is to have another rise in the scale this year. Such
a list of soloists and instructors was never before offered at
any summer institute of music, and then the grand organ
and other accessories!</p>

<p>Froebel is again to be commemorated. It is hoped that
some one will be prepared to give a succinct résumé of Froebelism.
The question, “What <i>is</i> kindergarten?” is one of
the unanswered conundrums of the day.</p>

<p>Prepare to smile—Frank Beard is coming again.</p>

<p>Some one once said he preferred to go sleigh-riding in the
summer, when he could enjoy the excursion without freezing
to death. Now one can go on a sea voyage without
being sea sick, and see the sights of a trip abroad without
the cost, expense, and fatigue of foreign travel. It was a
brilliant conception, that “Ideal Summer Trip Beyond the
Sea.” If it does not prove one of the hits of this season of
hits by the Hittites, we do not hit the mark in our guess.</p>

<p>The Museum has proved one of the great attractions at
Chautauqua ever since its inception, and the public will be
glad to read of the remarkable attractions now to be added
to it. Miller <i>fecit</i>, as usual.</p>

<p>“The morning hour” of metaphysics is to be abolished
and something more understandable taken up—Hebrew.</p>

<p>But the great day of all, the day of intellectual and spiritual
uplifting, is to be the “Commencement Day” of the C.
L. S. C. The joy and glory of the last one has not yet
ceased to echo “in the chambers of the soul.” It will be a
red, white and blue event—a red letter day, at a white heat
of fervor, and the blue sky over all. “Oh, who that feels
them ever will forget the emotions of those spirit-stirring
times!”</p>

<p>Chautauqua has sent its special reporter through all the
nations of the world and he will render this year his account.
Our voyager and explorer, Cook, was not eaten by
the savages like the earlier one; rather, he comes to spread
a civilized and civilizing symposium.</p>

<p>Returning Chautauquans will find the grounds much improved.
Besides the beautification and edification by private
enterprise and taste, visitors will find great changes
for the better wrought by the association. The most notable
of the many features of this work is to be seen on the lake-front
of the Athenæum Hotel. The avenue has been moved
down to the lake shore and made a most romantic drive on
the beach, and all the additional space is devoted to a sloping
lawn. All the disfiguring relics have been removed
from the vicinage, and this part of the grounds is as prim
and proper as a miss in her new summer gown.</p>

<p>Chautauqua continues to be the cheapest summer resort
and summer school in the world. For four dollars the resort
is open forty-three days—about nine cents a day. A
dollar a week secures the privilege of the lectures, concerts,
and all the “pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious”
Chautauqua after the Assembly proper begins. Is there
anything anywhere like that for cheapness? The highest-priced
thing at Chautauqua gives much more and better
than can be gotten elsewhere for the same sum. But after
all, there is here, what can not be gotten elsewhere for any
price, that is the most priceless of all, “The Chautauqua
Idea,” its inspiration, uplift, expansion, liberalizing.</p>

<p>Phonography is one of the most remunerative and surest
avocations now open to women, and a good opportunity to
acquire a knowledge of it from a master is open at Chautauqua
under Prof. Bridge.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CIRCLE_OF_THE_SCIENCES" id="THE_CIRCLE_OF_THE_SCIENCES">THE CIRCLE OF THE SCIENCES.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Prof. J. T. Edwards, of Chamberlain Institute, N. Y., is
to deliver a course of eight lectures before the C. T. R. at
Chautauqua this summer. “Physical Science” is to be the
subject of these lectures, the design being to show how all the
sciences, botany, zoölogy, etc., are but sectors of one great
circle, that one plan underlies all natural phenomena.
The lectures will be brilliantly illustrated and will be of peculiar
value to teachers. Prof. Edwards has sent us the following
outline of his work, which shows that though his
theme is extended, yet it is so systematized as to be very
simple:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/illus104.jpg" width="326" height="321" alt="circle diagram" />
</div>

<p>Nature is a unit. <i>E pluribus unum</i> might be taken for its
motto; the circle is its emblem; ten thousand radii touch
its circumference; every atom bears a relation to its center;
everything is connected with everything. It was not a
mere fancy that when the Creator made even the little
snow-drop, he adjusted it to the gravities of all worlds.
Humboldt chose “Cosmos” as the title of his immortal
work, and he defined it, “The doctrine of the universe, the
system of law, harmony and truth combined within the
universe.”</p>

<p>Glance at the copious index. What diversity in the subjects
discussed. We wonder how he will be able to fit into
beautiful mosaic all these fragments.</p>

<p>A large look at nature sees it one. The spectroscope now
tells us that all worlds are but “parts of one stupendous
whole.” Matter is ever changing, but never lost. Force is
indestructible; a thousand floods ten thousand years ago
prepared the earth for habitation. Feeble insects laid the
foundations of Paris and London perhaps millions of years
before the Romans drove piles into the Thames. Our stove
and coal bins are ninety millions of miles away. Nature
is full of beautiful dependencies. The animal feeds upon
the vegetable, and the latter lives upon the mineral kingdom.
The mere physical forces of light, heat and electricity are
doubtless directly connected with the noblest activities of
organized beings.</p>

<p>Now, one object of this course of lectures is to show things
in their connections. Bird’s-eye views are very essential
in the study of large landscapes. The poet is not the only
“maker.” Most minds prefer the concrete to the abstract—synthesis
to analysis. The gem is never so beautiful as in
its appropriate setting. The springing bow alone shows us
the splendor of each color.</p>

<p><i>Astronomy</i>, “Mother of the Sciences,” will “teach us our
place” among the worlds; will tell of the time when the
“morning stars were singing.” Some of the greatest and
some of the most devout minds of every age have delighted
in this study. Its votaries now, however, are no longer
alone on the watch-towers. Observers stand with them,
eager to gaze upon the stars, although with less trained vision.
Bishop Warren’s delightful book shows us the possibility
of being both accurate and interesting. He just supplements
“the look” that was given at “The Point” in the
days “lang syne,” with a longer and steadier gaze into the
heavens.</p>

<p>As Astronomy will show us the infinitely large, <i>Chemistry</i>
will bring to us the infinitely small. Here we are in Nature’s
laboratory. Listen! We can almost hear the myriad
atoms, like unseen battalions in the night, quietly falling
into line. It is as if we had penetrated the arcana of Nature.
See! Here she mingles her dyes. Hence come the
odors, the flavors, the forms of all substances. No wonder
the old alchemist hung over his crucible (<i>crux</i>, across—the
mark upon the vessel to guard against the <i>geests</i>, ghosts—<i>our
gas</i>—which threatened him) until the divining rod fell
from his palsied hand. There is a rare fascination in the
study. It so closely concerns human welfare. The useful
as well as the fine arts, agriculture, manufacturing, and all
our domestic life are intimately concerned in its discoveries
and progress, and when we have learned how wonderful a
thing is a molecule we are prepared to learn of masses of
minerals. <i>Mineralogy</i> is less understood than some other
of the natural sciences; for a few years past, however, it
has pushed forward rapidly. The impetus given to mining,
the formation of cabinets, of great mineralogical displays,
such as that at Denver the past year, and the mineral treasures
of Australia, California, and Colorado have awakened
much popular interest. Gold was mentioned in the first
chapter of Genesis, and the enumeration of precious stones
in various parts of the Old Testament, and in Revelation,
shows that the ancients were not unacquainted with the
more beautiful forms of minerals. It remained, however
for our time to show that even the clod beneath our feet,
the rock of the mountain, and the ice of the glacier are built
with the precision of a marble palace. There is a beautiful
simplicity in these combinations. They can all be reduced
to six primary forms. This science and the closely allied
branch of Crystalography fortunately can be made very
pleasing to the eye by means of the helps which we can
summon. Thus we are led by gradual steps to consider <i>Geology</i>,
or the study of the earth, as to its great features.
And what a theme it is! Ocean making! continent building!
mountain raising! making of worlds! The story is written
in strata by fossils, or in the markings left by some great
force in the earth’s crust.</p>

<p>No science has more interest for the artist, the architect,
the civil engineer. But perhaps a deeper and more solemn
interest attaches to it because of its relations to the all-important
truths of Revelation. Fortunately this branch of human
knowledge has not been forced to depend upon individual
enterprise or love of truth. It has knocked at the
halls of legislation; it has been welcomed to the palaces of
kings. For lo! it came promising greater riches than were
ever dreamed of by Spanish free-booters, and many a State
has found through it an El Dorado within its own limits.</p>

<p><i>Physics</i>, or Natural Philosophy, will next explain to us
more fully by illustration and apparatus, the characteristics
of those forces which join together the molecules, not less
than hold the worlds in harmony. It is an old science, but
has clothed itself in new garments. In some directions, as
in acoustics and light, it has made very wonderful progress
within the memory of the school-boy of to-day. The “Arabian
Nights” has few things to tell us so startling as that a
man can sit in his office in New York and hold converse
with a friend in Chicago.</p>

<p>Never before did man give such good promise of really entering
upon his heritage as master in this world, in the
spirit of the high destiny that was promised him at his creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Botany</i> comes next. It has been quite the fashion to look
upon this study as unworthy the attention of the vigorous
masculine mind—“a girl’s study, about posy-beds, the language
of flowers, and, at best, fit only for the decoration of a
poet’s verse!” And yet it concerns one whole wide realm
of nature. It has received little attention in our colleges,
scarcely finding a place in the curriculum of study.</p>

<p>It really embraces a number of separate sciences—economic,
agricultural, horticultural, medical and fossil botany.
Of late a new interest has been awakened in some of these.
The climatic relations of forests have become matter of legislative
inquiry. Great forestry conventions have been held,
and an able report upon the subject has been made by the
Commissioner of Agriculture. A gentleman in New York
has just made an appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars
for the best collection of woods in the world. Aside
from these utilitarian views of the matter it is enough for
us to know that the Great Teacher said: “Consider the
lilies,” and often upon Olivet or “by cool Siloam’s shady
rill,” seemed to take pleasure in the trees and flowers which
his own hand had made.</p>

<p><i>Zoölogy</i> will show us a comparative view of the animal
creation. A whole literature upon this subject has sprung
up within a few years. Darwin and Huxley have added
many close and admirable observations upon the habits of
animals. Numerous books have appeared upon “Mind
in Animals,” “Higher Life in Animals,” and kindred topics,
until one almost trembles for his rank in the scale of
being. Indeed, when royalty weeps over the departure of
Jumbo, and lap-dogs and canaries win the first place in the
hearts of fair ladies, we may well review our claims as
“lords of creation.”</p>

<p>The study of the Creator’s last great work—man, <i>Physiology</i>,
comes next in the order of our series. “Fearfully and
wonderfully made,” said the sacred writer, and every discovery
of the microscope, every analysis of the scalpel, every
astute and learned study of eye, ear, heart or brain, but
repeats the declaration, “Know thyself,” urged by one of old
as a duty, but it is also a high privilege. A knowledge of
physiology and hygiene lies at the very foundation of the
science of human welfare. We are now claiming it as a
mighty missionary agency in the conversion of the heathen.
Ah! it is a rare power to know one’s own make-up and limitations,
to the end that the free spirit may do its best. Then
again, every one must some day stand where this knowledge
will be useful to others; and what higher aim have we
than to enrich others with our own knowledge? One can
be miserly with his ideas as with his money. Helping with
useful knowledge is of that giving which does not impoverish.</p>

<p>Doubtless to cover so wide a field we shall have to study
carefully the fine “art of leaving out.” Some other things
we must surely remember. For example:</p>

<p>1. To pursue the Golconda miner’s method—save the diamonds.</p>

<p>2. Adopt the motto of the great dailies, “condense.”</p>

<p>3. Popularize—if possible strip off the technicalities, and
present truth in such a way that busy men and women may
readily secure it.</p>

<p>4. Be accurate as far as we go, and help minds to go farther.</p>

<p>5. Encourage to self-help, to observe nature, to study, to
experiment. Why be thirsty with the Amazon flowing
around us?</p>

<p>6. To use all helps appropriate to each subject, by which
ideas may be borne to the mind through that sense best calculated
to convey them.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHAUTAUQUA_SCHOOL_OF" id="THE_CHAUTAUQUA_SCHOOL_OF">THE CHAUTAUQUA SCHOOL OF
THEOLOGY.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>SECRETARY’S STATEMENT.</h3>

<p>Nearly two hundred persons, some in foreign lands, are
enrolled as students in the Chautauqua School of Theology.
Their distribution in the departments shows that ninety-nine
have elected to take practical theology, eighty-nine
Greek, and twenty-five Hebrew. The other departments
have each a smaller number. Many are taking the studies
in two or more departments, and one student is already prepared
for his examination.</p>

<p>The undertaking is constantly receiving hearty endorsement
in educational and literary centers, where recognition
has eminent value and influence.</p>

<p>Leading educators and clergymen are becoming better acquainted
both with the needs which have called the Chautauqua
School of Theology into being, its grand purposes,
its undenominationalism, its evangelical catholicity, and
with the remarkable feasibility of its methods.</p>

<p>Doubters have already been forced to admit that the curriculum
of the Chautauqua School of Theology affords the
untrained preacher who by circumstances was crowded past
the doors of college and seminary into the pulpit, his best,
if not his <i>only</i> privilege to supply deficiencies.</p>

<p>The qualities of seriousness, earnestness, and conscientious
faithfulness, which are inseparable from the true theological
student, characterize without exception the students
of the Chautauqua School of Theology. It is indeed
one special merit of the School that its members come to its
curriculum only after ascertaining their <i>real wants</i>, their
personal adaptation to technical training, or their special
needs; or, it may be, their peculiar disqualifications for the
work of the ministry. Hence they possess a clearness of
aim and a vigor of purpose which are certain to command
success. Necessarily, therefore, the atmosphere of the
School work is tonic and healthful.</p>

<p>The eminent theologians, associated with the president,
Rev. John H. Vincent, S.T.D., as deans of departments,
everywhere inspire confidence in the quality of the training
furnished. They have entered upon their peculiarly difficult
labors with enthusiasm born of confidence in the possibilities
of usefulness preëminently afforded them in the Chautauqua
School of Theology.</p>

<p>By a recent arrangement Dr. L. T. Townsend, D.D., who
from the beginning has borne like a Hercules the school
work, places the burdens of the deanship upon the general
secretary, retaining the two departments which he conducts
with such distinguished success. His absence in Europe
will not interfere with the work in his several classes.</p>

<p>The officers, departments, and deans of the School are as
follows: President, Rev. John H. Vincent, S.T.D.; Dean and
General Secretary, Rev. Alfred A. Wright, A.M.</p>


<h3>DEPARTMENTS.</h3>

<p>I. Hebrew: Rev. William R. Harper, Ph.D., Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>For the school curriculum, or for special information, address
Rev. John H. Vincent, S.T.D., drawer 75, New Haven,
Conn., or Rev. Alfred A. Wright, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>After June 1, 1883, all moneys from any source due the
Chautauqua School of Theology for books, tuition, or on postage
account, are to be paid to the general secretary.</p>

<h2><a name="EDITORS_OUTLOOK" id="EDITORS_OUTLOOK">EDITOR’S OUTLOOK.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>TEN YEARS OF CHAUTAUQUA.</h3>

<p>This is the Chautauqua decennial year. Is it possible
that it is ten years? So rapid has been the growth, so
many and varied the ideas and features added from year to
year, that we have not noted the flight of time. Not in the
space of a single editorial can be cited the results of the first
decade of Chautauqua history. It seems strange to remember
that only ten years ago Chautauqua and Chautauqua
Lake were comparatively unknown. Of the thousands who
now, from north and south, east and west, annually flock
hither, few had then even heard of its existence. It is not
egotism, but only just to say that the lake owes its now national
fame to the present Chautauqua of the lake.</p>

<p>The visitor of ten or even five years ago is struck with the
changes in the physical aspect of the local Chautauqua.
Then a few rude cottages and tents in the woods with undressed
and unkept grounds, now a large village of beautiful
summer homes. The unsightly tent has yielded to the
one graceful and attractive, and tents and cottages are all
ranged in comely streets. Ruts and gullies have been replaced
with grades and lawns. Even the old Auditorium
which was thought in former days to be without a rival of
its kind, though still standing there in honor, has been compelled
to yield precedence to the amphitheater of vaster proportions
and better appointments. But the list is too long
for recital. There is the grand Hotel Athenæum, said to
rival any wood structure in the State, and equally superlative
in every quality as a home for its guests; there too is
the Oriental House, Model of Jerusalem, Hall of Philosophy,
Children’s Temple, Tabernacle, and, if you listen a
moment, there is sound of hammer and saw as the work of
building and improving goes on rapidly as ever.</p>

<p>But if all this is of the local Chautauqua, what of the
Chautauqua which is national—nay, more than national?
Ten years ago from a very few of the neighboring States
was gathered the first Sunday-school Assembly. To-day
the methods and ideas of that and subsequent assemblies
are being employed and taught by thousands of Sunday-school
teachers throughout the Union. Then, the able and
eloquent speakers that stood on the platform were heard only
within the range of their vocal power, but now the pages of
the <i>Assembly Daily Herald</i> catch their thoughts and send
them to distances of hundreds and thousands of miles in all
directions. The <i>personnel</i> of the Chautauqua platform, excellent
as it was in the beginning, has been enhanced each
year by others of the most distinguished thinkers, scholars
and orators of this country and from beyond the waters.</p>

<p>We do not know how many dreamers there may have
been, nor what their dreams, but certainly none of the thousands
of enthusiastic visitors to Chautauqua in those days
dreamed of the C. L. S. C. with tens of thousands of earnest
students, of the School of Languages, Teachers’ Retreat, and
School of Theology, with all their characteristics of power
and inspiration.</p>

<p>Ten years of Chautauqua! Prolific mother, not alone of
the above offspring, but of children resembling herself, and
doing similar work at Lakeside, Lake Bluff, South Framingham,
at Monterey, on the Pacific slope, at Monteagle,
Tenn., and elsewhere. Only ten years! and yet the “Chautauqua
Idea” has taken root, and is yielding its fruit of popular
education in all the States and in the Territories. Ten
years, and the meridian is not yet reached. Ten years are
but a beginning in any work so far reaching, so broad in its
scope as the work of Chautauqua. What has been done is
but the starting point to what will be done. The years to
follow have much to reveal in the maturity of the plans and
principles now in operation, and of new ones yet to be inaugurated.</p>

<h3>SOCIAL LIFE IN THE C. L. S. C.</h3>

<p>The C. L. S. C. is becoming a great social power. From
the first it has recognized that one of the great needs of the
majority of the people is healthy, active companionship;
that for such companionship people will undertake tasks
for which they have otherwise little taste, and under its
stimulus will do much good work. It has recognized that
if the social life be kept clean and invigorating, there is no
danger of any one sinking into idleness or vice. Its power
for good lies in the fact that its method of work contains
the very elements which are necessary for a pure,
wholesome social life. In the first place it calls people together
regularly and insures their intimate acquaintance.
One of the great hindrances to cordial social intercourse is
that people do not meet frequently and informally, so that
they know each other well. We are prone to invest those
with whom we have but a passing acquaintance with a dignity
or knowledge so superior to our own that we are actually
afraid of them. The local circle breaks this up. We
learn to know our associates. No less important is it that the
members of society take their rank according to merit. No
other standard will be used in local circles. The ability to
lead is the only quality which will give a member the leadership.
The C. L. S. C. is veritably the People’s College,
leveling all ranks.</p>

<p><i>The</i> reason, we may say, for the flatness of social life in
the ordinary town, is that the members have, or find, so
little to think about. People will not gossip, nor be recklessly
extravagant, nor indulge in insipid flirtations if they
have wholesome subjects for thought. The course of reading
furnishes topics of vigor and interest. The mind is kept
active. The tone of the society is changed, because the
members are thinking and are experiencing the pleasure of
an interchange of ideas and knowledge. Their society life
becomes a recreation, instead, as is so often the case, dissipation.</p>

<p>There is, besides, a hearty good fellowship animating the
circles generally, which is one of their most promising features.
The true college spirit seems to inspire everyone
with its life, energy, and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>To what results have these elements led? Thousands of
circles have been formed all over the country, meeting for
intellectual culture, but bound together by strong friendship
and sociability. In themselves these circles are very powerful,
but there are numberless offshoots which are intended
to develop cordial feeling among the members.
Among these are the large reunions, calling together the
different classes and circles. Invariably the reports of these
affairs show that all the appointments are in taste, and even
elegance. Memorial days furnish frequent opportunities for
entertainments as pleasant as the reunions. Large numbers
of guests are frequently invited, the hall, church, or
parlor is decorated, bountiful refreshments are served, and
a carefully prepared and spicy program carried out. Numbers
of programs, some of them exquisite in design and finish,
are sent to us, giving the exercises of various memorial
celebrations, and almost every circle reports some charming
novelty in entertainments. Nor are these large and ambitious
gatherings all. Informal “socials” sometimes take
the place of the usual work. The regular study hour is followed
by a merry half-hour devoted to games, music, spelling-matches,
pronouncing contests, or “visiting.”</p>

<p>All these pleasant features are combined to develop a
strong social feeling in every circle. New and better views
of our social relations are opened up, and we learn, perhaps
for the first time, what good fellowship means. The good
which is done is inestimable. Indeed, we do not hesitate to
say that the opportunities of the C. L. S. C. for social culture
are excelled only by the opportunities it affords for mental
culture.</p>

<h3>THE ROEBLINGS.</h3>

<p>The slab of black marble in the crypt of St. Paul’s Cathedral,
London, which marks the last resting place of the
English architect, Sir Christopher Wren, bears the inscription,
in Latin, “If you would have his monument, look
about you.” In the great Brooklyn bridge, recently opened
for travel, people will see for ages the noble monument of
those two men of genius—father and son—John Augustus
and Washington A. Roebling. The men whose names are
inseparably linked with such a work—a work, not for an
age, but for the ages—have secured a fame to satisfy any
human ambition. In the case of these great engineers we
see again the old law illustrated: the world’s good comes
from sacrifice. The one sacrificed life, the other health, to
the work whose future benefits to mankind are so incalculable.</p>

<p>The elder Roebling was born in Mühlhausen, Prussia,
June 12, 1806, and was educated at the polytechnic school in
Berlin. He came to this country at the age of twenty-five,
and settled near Pittsburgh. He worked for some time as
an engineer on certain Pennsylvania canals, and was then
engaged for three years in surveying the route of the Pennsylvania
Central Railroad through the Alleghenies. In the
city of Pittsburgh he established works for the manufacture
of wire ropes—which manufacture he introduced into
America. The works were afterward removed to Trenton,
N. J. It was his aim to bring about the use of wire ropes
in the construction of bridges, and in time he was successful.
He was the father of suspension bridges in this country.
His first work was the suspended aqueduct of the
Pennsylvania Canal across the Allegheny River, which was
completed in 1845. Soon after this he built the Monongahela
suspension bridge at Pittsburgh, and some suspension
aqueducts on the Delaware and Hudson Canal. A much
greater work than any of these was the Niagara suspension
bridge, the building of which he undertook in 1851, and
carried to a successful completion. But this was surpassed
by the bridge across the Ohio at Cincinnati, which he completed
in 1867. The length of the Niagara bridge is 821 feet,
while that at Cincinnati has a clear span of 1,057 feet. It
was in the winter of 1853, when, at one time, Mr. Roebling,
his wife and son, were detained for several hours, while
crossing East River, by the floating ice, that the idea, which
certain others had entertained, of a bridge from New York
to Brooklyn first took possession of his mind; but it was
not until 1865 that steps were taken looking to the practical
realization of the idea. Then this engineer prepared plans
and estimates for the work, and in time the great structure
was under way, whose history is now known and read of all
men, and which stands as one of the latest marvels of the
nineteenth century. The work was hardly commenced
when the life of its author was cut short. In July, 1869, his
foot was crushed by a ferry-boat, as he was standing on the
pier at Fulton Ferry in Brooklyn, and his death followed in
two weeks.</p>

<p>The younger Roebling was born at Saxonburg, Butler
County, Pa., May 26, 1837. He graduated from the Polytechnic
Institute at Troy, in 1857. He early became his father’s
assistant in engineering, and came in time to be fully
the equal, if not the superior, of his father in his peculiar
line of work. He enlisted as a private in the Union Army
at the breaking out of the rebellion, and had an honorable
career as a soldier, rising to the rank of colonel. After the
close of the war he spent some time in Europe, studying the
more important works of engineering there. The death of
his father left him the work of building the great bridge, of
executing his father’s plans. Those plans were greatly
modified by himself, and the completed bridge is by no
means but the embodiment of the elder Roebling’s conception.
In 1872 Colonel Roebling became the victim of the
“caisson disease,” so called, and since that time has been
an invalid. He is probably an invalid for life. But he continued
at the head of the great enterprise, and from his sick-room
has directed the work until at length it has been
brought to a glorious consummation. He has had in his
wife a most faithful and efficient coadjutor in all his work.
Mention of her name should not be omitted in the laudations
paid to the builders of Brooklyn bridge.</p>

<h3>THE CORONATION OF THE CZAR.</h3>

<p>After long delay and months of seclusion from his subjects,
Alexander III. has been crowned Czar of all the Russias.
The coronation ceremonies took place at Moscow, in
the Church of the Assumption, in the Kremlin, within
whose walls all the Romanoffs have been crowned. Vast
concourses of people thronged the streets and crowded the
thoroughfares of the city, the Kremlin was packed with a
dense mass of humanity, intent on witnessing the imposing
ceremonies of the coronation. Princes of every rank and
government officials of all degrees were present from all
parts of his broad domains to do homage to their master.
The crowned heads of Europe sent their representatives to
grace the august occasion and to convey their greetings and
good wishes to the new-made monarch.</p>

<p>The pageant of the coronation is said to have been the
most magnificent spectacle witnessed in Europe in modern
times. It is estimated that not less than ten millions of
dollars were expended in its preparation. The czar was
everywhere received by his subjects with the greatest enthusiasm,
seeming to betoken the utmost loyalty and reverence
toward their rightful monarch. Nothing occurred to
mar the pomp and splendor of the occasion. No bombs
were thrown, no mines were exploded, no hostile demonstrations
of any kind were made; everything seemed to
indicate the return of an era of peace and security in the
lately perturbed realm of Russia.</p>

<p>The crown with which the czar was invested is said to be
worth not less than three millions of roubles, but it is as
heavily ladened with cares as with jewels. No other ruler
in Europe to-day has so unenviable a throne or rests under
such heavy burdens and responsibilities. His vast domains
have no bond of integral unity, save the military power,
while in whole provinces the inhabitants are but one remove
from barbarism. In addition to this the Nihilistic
organization, which pervades all Europe, is strongly intrenched
in his kingdom, and may, like a sleeping volcano,
burst out in the future, as it has in the recent past, with
terrible fury and disastrous results. Its representatives are
everywhere; in the towns, cities and country; in the army
and palace; among peasants and princes of the realm.
Their threats of violence forced the czar into involuntary
seclusion, and were the cause of his long delay in assuming
the crown.</p>

<p>While the deeds of violence which have characterized the
Nihilistic movement can not but be deprecated, they find
some palliation in the fact that Russia has been the worst
governed country in all Europe. Its czar is an absolute despot,
and inasmuch as princes are not usually slow to use all
the power placed at their disposal, Russian subjects have
for centuries experienced all the ills coincident with an absolute
despotism. It is true that serfdom has been abolished,
but the tardy justice which accomplished this great work
but whetted the appetite of the Russian people for larger
liberty, and for the rightful privileges conceded by other
European governments to their subjects. Their demands
in this direction have been hitherto sternly denied. Every
effort for their attainment has been met with the most determined
opposition on the part of the government. For
even slight political offenses, men are seized, and, with a
mere apology of a trial, are condemned, and sentenced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
penal servitude in the mines of Siberia. They are compelled
to labor there from twelve to eighteen hours per day, at the
hardest kind of toil and under the surveillance of brutal
overseers. They are furnished but a meager supply of food,
and that of an inferior kind. They are exposed to the stern
severities of the Siberian winters, with but a scant supply
of clothing and little shelter. Within five or six years
death usually kindly puts a terminus to the sufferings of
the miserable exiles.</p>

<p>It is barbarities like these on the part of the government
that has put the sword and the bomb in the hand of the
Russian Nihilist. Goaded by opposition and aggravated by
the denial of the rights of citizenship, its subjects have resorted
to the worst of revolutionary measures to secure the
redress of their wrongs and the possession of the rights conceded
to the subjects of other European states. It is to be
hoped that the new czar may learn from the lessons of the
past that the days of despots and autocrats are numbered,
and that the nineteenth century of the Christian era is an
age when the rights of subjects can not be disregarded, even
by crowned heads, with impunity. The only possible way
in which Alexander III. can secure the prolonged peace and
perpetuity of his kingdom is to adopt a liberal policy toward
his subjects, institute measures to redress their many and
grievous wrongs, and surrender to the people or their representatives
a portion of the power now lodged in his hands,
which is by far too great for any monarch to possess, and
which renders him alike dangerous to the state and to his
subjects.</p>

<h3>AMOS K. WARREN.</h3>

<p>On the evening of the 9th of June, the well-known Secretary
of the Chautauqua Assembly, Mr. A. K. Warren, died
at his home in Mayville, N. Y., after an illness of several
weeks. Mr. Warren was in the fifty-ninth year of his age,
and, since the close of the third Assembly, in 1876, he has
had charge of the business at Chautauqua, under the leadership
and direction of Mr. Lewis Miller and the Board of
Trustees. He grew in favor with the Chautauqua management
and the general public from the time he first assumed
the duties of his office. It was Mr. Warren that effected
the purchase of the one hundred acres of land to add to
the original Chautauqua grounds, and with taste and untiring
zeal laid out pleasant walks and public parks, continually
increasing the convenience and the beauty of the
grounds.</p>

<p>Several of the most valued public buildings were erected
during these years of his connection with the Assembly—the
Children’s Temple and Hall of Philosophy, the Amphitheater
and the commodious Hotel Athenæum. He has
shown himself to be wise and skillful in executing the
plans of President Miller and the Board. His loss will be
keenly felt and the position he occupied difficult to fill. In
addition to the office he occupied at Chautauqua Mr. Warren
has served as sheriff of Chautauqua County, and at one
time was manager of the Buffalo, Pittsburgh &amp; Western
Railroad. In every position he proved himself to be a man
of superior executive ability, born to be a leader of men and
a manager of great movements. He leaves a widow and
one daughter, well provided for by certain property which
he owned and by an insurance of seven thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The funeral services were held in Mayville, June 13, at
his late residence, being conducted by the Rev. Milton
Smith, of Mayville. The Scriptures were read by the Rev.
Dr. Flood, and the prayer offered and remarks made by the
Rev. Dr. Vincent. Although not a member of the Church,
Mr. Warren was a believer in the Christian religion.
Were we permitted to break the confidence of the private
correspondence which passed between Dr. Vincent and Mr.
Warren just before his death, much would be revealed that
would be comforting to the friends of the deceased and inspiring
to all believers in Christianity.</p>

<p>His death brought together a large number of people,
among them many of the Executive Board, who were obliged
to call a meeting at once at Mayville in order to reorganize
the working forces of the Assembly and supply the place
left vacant by Mr. Warren’s death.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great loss sustained, it is expected
that under the direction of President Miller and the Board,
the work of improvement and building will be carried on as
usual. The management is so complete that no work will be
neglected nor any department be slighted. The grounds are
in excellent condition as are also the streets, walks and
public buildings, and improvement will constantly go on.</p>

<p>Some railroad managers are employing the machinery of
the Young Men’s Christian Association among their men
with good results. Mr. Vanderbilt employs a religious
worker on a regular salary to keep open a room and conduct
religious services for the benefit of his men in New
York. The N. Y., P. &amp; O. R. R., a trunk line to the west,
running past Chautauqua, has adopted the same plan in
Meadville, Cleveland, and other cities. Railroad men are
absent from home a good portion of their time when on
duty, and, as strangers in strange places, they are greatly
benefited by the religious homes provided by the corporations.</p>

<p>The Hon. James G. Blaine seems to have retired from political
life. A Washington correspondent, who evidently
has studied his habits, says in a New York paper: “It is
with his venture into literature that Mr. Blaine has mostly
occupied his mind this spring. He seems suddenly to have
discovered the charms of the library and the study, and as
he has a literary workshop that is as suggestive and delightful
as money can make it, he is drinking the newly-discovered
cup to the dregs. His library is on the second
floor. Here, after he has breakfasted, he repairs and plunges
into his work. Occasional visits to the Congressional Library
furnish him with much of the data that he requires
for his work, and this is supplemented by correspondence,
by his own letters and private records, and, more than all,
by a memory that seems to be able to recall all the events
of his twenty years of public life as though they were all
crowded into yesterday. It is not Mr. Blaine’s intention to
make the work in any sense a series of personal reminiscences,
but briefly to describe, as a historian, the important
public events of the past twenty years. There is a good
deal of curiosity already to get hints of how he is doing it;
but he keeps his own counsel, and asks advice and hints of
no one. He spends five or six hours daily on this work,
only quitting his desk in time to take his afternoon drive.
He expects to finish the work early in the winter.”</p>

<p>The dean of the Chautauqua School of Theology, the Rev.
A. A. Wright, of Boston, Mass., is noticed by Dr. Daniel S.
Steele, in <i>Zion’s Herald</i>, thus: “It was the boast of Tyndale,
before he translated the New Testament into English,
that he would enable the very plow-boys to know more
about the New Testament than the bishops themselves.
The attempt of Bro. Wright is more audacious. He has undertaken
to make the plow-boys and kitchen-maids know
more of the original New Testament Greek than the professionals
themselves, who acquired their knowledge in the
slipshod and unscientific methods in vogue only forty years
ago. In carrying out his scheme he is constructing a serial
lexicon on a novel principle. He selects the most important
word and groups under it all its derivatives and compounds
in Greek and English, requiring a memorizing of these
seed-words. Thus the student’s mind becomes a nursery in
which a whole forest of Greek is sprouting.”</p>

Mr. A. W. Pike is president and Mrs. M. A. F. Adams is
secretary of the alumni association. The C. L. S. C. has
more than doubled its numbers in New England during the

<p>John B. Gough says: “The lecture business is declining,
because the people are inclining to music and theatricals.”
We presume this is true where the people have nothing but
<i>lectures</i> and <i>lectures</i>; under such circumstances it is not a
cause for wonder, but if any person will take the pains to
read the reports of “Local Circles” published in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
the past ten months they will observe how lectures
on a wide range of subjects, scientific and historical,
philosophical and practical, have been made popular, intermingled
as they have been with concerts, reunions, banquets,
social life and a variety of entertainments by enterprising
organizations.</p>

<p>The symposium on the “Moral Influence of the Drama,”
in the June number of the <i>North American Review</i>, is an
able discussion of the subject. Dr. Buckley wields a keen
lance, but there is a time for all things. The editorial management
that brings on this discussion in the summer time,
when the theaters are mostly closed, is not likely to do so
much toward correcting existing evils as if it had
brought on the debate when the theaters are opened in the
fall time. The adaptation of truth to an end is wisdom, but
the adaptation in this case is to the end of the season, when
the evil is done, <i>vapor and effervescence</i>.</p>

<p>We have some sympathy with the idea expressed by a
correspondent in a western State, that we should have degrees
conferred on the graduates of the C. L. S. C., under
certain limitations, and in recognition of certain attainments
in literature, history, etc. The degree of the Ph.D.
is now conferred by some universities and colleges after the
applicant has passed required examinations, though he
has never been within the walls of the institution.</p>

<p>Postmaster General Gresham has introduced practical
civil service reform into his department. In a recent order
he has issued to postmasters, of the second and third classes,
he says that the postmaster must be in his office and attend
to the business in person; absence from his post, without
permission from the Postoffice Department, will be
considered sufficient reason for dismissal from the service.
This is a wise and timely order, and General Gresham deserves
the thanks of the people of the country for inaugurating
this reform.</p>

<p>Alaska is sadly in need of a civil government. The lectures
of the Presbyterian missionary, Dr. Sheldon Jackson,
on the condition of the people of Alaska, delivered at
Chautauqua and published in the <span class="smcap">Assembly Herald</span> and
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, created quite a sensation and attracted
the attention of thinking Christian people in all parts of
the country. There is great need of interposition by the
government at Washington. The Presbyterian General
Assembly, at a recent session in Saratoga, appointed a
committee, with Dr. Howard Crosby as chairman, to visit
President Arthur relative to giving the people of Alaska a
civil government. Let missionary societies and Christian
assemblies petition the powers that be until Alaska is redeemed
from her present state, which is little better in some
places than barbarism.</p>

<p>The reasons for divorces are only equalled by the devices
which parties adopt to secure them. Major Nickerson, of
the United States army, sent his wife and daughter to Europe
in 1880. The major promised to follow them soon,
providing he could secure leave of absence. His wife
waited but he did not come. He continued to write her
and send money, until about a year ago he began to send
his letters and remittances to his daughter. His wife
asked an explanation, but he gave her no satisfaction. At
last she learned through her mother that he had obtained a
divorce and was married again, and that the ground on
which the divorce was obtained was desertion. The bare
statement of the facts in such a case teach us that our laws,
as to granting divorces, are lax and unscriptural, and should
be reconstructed in the interests of justice and the safety of
the family as an institution against designing men.</p>

<p>The Argentine Republic is doing a great deal of quiet
work in education, which might even be an example to us
who look upon that far-away land as out of the world.
They have in their national college a greater proportion

the most advanced methods, the government has just obtained
eight young women from the normal schools at
Winona, Minn., to take charge of the normal schools in the

<p>Curiosity and lack of coolness were the causes of the terrible
disaster which marred Decoration Day of 1883, and
threw a shadow over the glory of the Brooklyn bridge. To
rush to see what is the cause of a crowd, a sudden noise or
confusion, is a childish act, and yet there is hardly one in a
hundred but will do it. To keep still and cool when the
crowd becomes a stampede is almost unknown. How to
prevent a panic and how to act in a panic, are questions
worthy the study of all intelligent people, and it might not
be amiss to teach the principles of coolness and self-restraint
to the young.</p>

a Roman abbot, introduced the method of dating from
the birth of Christ. It is conceded that he placed the date
four years too late, a fact of no importance in chronology,
as all that is necessary is to place the Savior’s birth 4 B. C.</p>

<h2><a name="TALK_ABOUT_BOOKS" id="TALK_ABOUT_BOOKS">TALK ABOUT BOOKS.</a></h2>
<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The first essential in a popular work of any kind is clearness. A
glance at the contents of Prof. Welsh’s new history of English literature<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
shows that the work is so systematically arranged that one
can not fail to understand it. The life of the nation which shaped
the literature of each period is graphically and simply described.
Each political, national, and social law which helped to form the
thoughts and customs of the people, is noticed. The leading writers
are discussed under the different heads of biography, writing, style,
rank, character, and influence. This tabular method has, by no
means, degraded the book into simply a school text-book. It has
made it suitable for that and more valuable to the general reader.
The style is fresh, never tiresome. The illustrations are so woven
into the narrative that an idea of the plan of the book is readily seen,
and besides the quotations are admirably chosen. The work has
been wrought enthusiastically and conscientiously by a man thoroughly
interested in what he was doing. Its reception has been his
reward.</p>

<p>The Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> have completed
Mr. Froude’s task of reminiscence editing, and given the curious
public ample information about the private life and character
of Thomas Carlyle. The task has not been a pleasant one for Mr.
Froude, but it has been faithfully and modestly performed. These
letters are curiously interesting for many reasons. They are vivacious
and sparkling, full of lively character sketches, and reveal the
private life of one of the most discussed men of the age. Better than
all of these, they introduce us to a woman to whom Arthur Helps once
candidly said: “Well, really, you are a model wife,” to whom poor
Mazzini could go whenever “in a state of crisis” (as he put it);
whom Mills, Jeffrey, Tennyson, and many others, honored for her
wit and womanliness. She was a clever woman, and a brave one.
None but a clever woman could have written these charming letters,
none but a brave one could have endured a husband like Carlyle.
She was too loyal to cease loving him, too strong to complain, though
many a letter shows her sense of his weakness. Jane Welsh Carlyle
will find a permanent place among the famous women of the century
for wifely devotion, as well as for being a brilliant letter-writer.</p>

<p>The book is chiefly valuable for its wide range of happily-told anecdotes,
and its spicy comments. Here is a picture of Lord Jeffrey
and Count D’Orsay, who were calling on her together: “What a difference!
The prince of critics and the prince of dandies! How washed
out the beautiful dandiacal face looked beside that little clever old
man’s! The large blue dandiacal eyes you would say had never
contemplated anything more interesting than the reflection of the
handsome personage they pertained to in a looking-glass, while
the dark penetrating ones of the other had taken notes of most
things in God’s universe, even seeing a good way into millstones.”
She makes wise and true as well as pointed comments on the wide
range of men and society that came under her notice.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Robert Browning’s “Jocoseria”<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> has been the most
read and most thoroughly noticed of any book of poems of the season.
It is a simple little volume of but ten poems. The best of them
all is the unpretending one beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

<p>The most influential book of the present day is undoubtedly the
novel. They constitute four-fifths of all the books read. The philosophy
of its development has become not only a question of great
literary interest, but one of educational and moral interest. Mr.
Sydney Lanier, in 1881, delivered a course of twelve lectures before
the students of John Hopkins University, on this subject, and they
have recently been published in book form,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> forming a highly interesting
and philosophical discussion. His object is to show that the
growth in sentiment since the days of the Greeks has been so great
that the old forms of literature and art have been inadequate to express
our ideas, hence in the last two centuries three things have been
developed—Science, Music, and the Novel. He gives most copious
illustrations from modern novels to uphold his principles.</p>

<p>Lovers of American poetry and poets will be glad to welcome the
recent “Life of William Cullen Bryant.”<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> Soon after Mr. Bryant’s
death in 1878 his papers, containing useful materials for a biography
of his life, were sent to Mr. Parke Godwin, a gentleman of long connection
with the press, in order that he might prepare a memoir of
the poet. Mr. Godwin has collected most of Mr. Bryant’s letters, his
editorial writings, and the newspaper articles concerning him, until
he has been able to lay before his readers a very complete and exact
biography. Necessarily the work contains little of intense interest.
Bryant’s life was a quiet, laborious one. Fifty years of it were spent
in editorial work in which, as the author well says, “the labors consist
of a series of incessant blows, of the real influence of which it is
hard to judge.” But his career as editor and poet are well treated
in a simple, pleasant narrative, which leave one with a profound respect
for the upright, just and noble father of American poetry.</p>

<p>In September, 1881, the Presbyterian Church lost one of its most
honored ministers by the death of the Rev. Cyrus Dickson, D.D., the
Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions. The Presbytery of Baltimore
at once arranged to prepare a memorial. The work was
committed to the Rev. S. J. M. Eaton, D.D.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> The biography which
Dr. Eaton has produced is a simple story of a devout, self-sacrificing
Christian. Such books never fail in their purpose. The story of
a life is, after all, the most influential of stories.</p>

<p>One of the best of the many sets of school readers, is the “Globe
Readings.”<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> Beginning with the simple primers of two grades there
are six readers in which the selections are very carefully graded, followed
by a “Book of Golden Deeds,” by Charlotte Yonge; Lamb’s
“Tales from Shakspere;” Scott’s “Marmion;” “Lay of the Last
Minstrel,” and “Lady of the Lake;” Cowper’s “Task,” and Goldsmith’s
“Vicar of Wakefield.” The series has been carefully edited,
and the notes give just the amount of help necessary to young readers.</p>

<p>The “Home College Series”<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> has reached the number of thirty-two.
They cover a great range of subjects. History, science, biography,
art, house-keeping, penmanship, wise-sayings, political economy
and religion, and will be valuable reading for spare moments.</p>

<p>The last issues of the charming “Riverside Literature Series,”<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>
are “Biographical Stories” and “True Stories from New England
History.”</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
